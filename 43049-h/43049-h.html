        part of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The
        Golden Bough</span></span> I have discussed the problem which gives
        its title to the whole work. If I am right, the Golden Bough over
        which the King of the Wood, Diana's priest at Aricia, kept watch and
        ward was no other than a branch of mistletoe growing on an oak within
        the sacred grove; and as the plucking of the bough was a necessary
        prelude to the slaughter of the priest, I have been led to institute
        a parallel between the King of the Wood at Nemi and the Norse god
        Balder, who was worshipped in a sacred grove beside the beautiful
        Sogne fiord of Norway and was said to have perished by a stroke of
        mistletoe, which alone of all things on earth or in heaven could
        wound him. On the theory here suggested both Balder and the King of
        the Wood personified in a sense the sacred oak of our Aryan
        forefathers, and both had deposited their lives or souls for safety
        in the parasite which sometimes, though rarely, is found growing on
        an oak and by the very rarity of its appearance excites the wonder
        and stimulates the devotion of ignorant men. Though I am now less
        than ever disposed to lay weight on the analogy between the Italian
        priest and the Norse god, I have allowed it to stand because it
        furnishes me with a pretext for discussing not only the general
        question of the external soul in popular superstition, but also the
        fire-festivals of Europe, since fire played a part both in the myth
        of Balder and in the ritual of the Arician grove. Thus Balder the

        more than a stalking-horse to carry two heavy pack-loads of facts.
        And what is true of Balder applies equally to the priest of Nemi
        himself, the nominal hero of the long tragedy of human folly and
        suffering which has unrolled itself before the readers of these
        volumes, and on which the curtain is now about to fall. He, too, for
        all the quaint garb he wears and the gravity with which he stalks
        across the stage, is merely a puppet, and it is time to unmask him
        before laying him up in the box.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To drop metaphor,
        while nominally investigating a particular problem of ancient
        mythology, I have really been discussing questions of more general
        interest which concern the gradual evolution of human thought from
        savagery to civilization. The enquiry is beset with difficulties of
        many kinds, for the record of man's mental development is even more
        imperfect than the record of his physical development, and it is
        harder to read, not only by reason of the incomparably more subtle
        and complex nature of the subject, but because the reader's eyes are
        apt to be dimmed by thick mists of passion and prejudice, which cloud
        in a far less degree the fields of comparative anatomy and geology.
        My contribution to the history of the human mind consists of little
        more than a rough and purely provisional classification of facts
        gathered almost entirely from printed sources. If there is one
        general conclusion which seems to emerge from the mass of
        particulars, I venture to think that it is the essential similarity
        in the working of the less developed human mind among all races,
        which corresponds to the essential similarity in their bodily frame
        revealed by comparative anatomy. But while this general mental
        similarity may, I believe, be taken as established, we must always be
        on our guard against tracing to it a multitude of particular
        resemblances which may be and often are due to simple diffusion,
        since nothing is more certain than <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "pagevii">[pg vii]</span><a name="Pgvii" id="Pgvii" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> that the various races of men have borrowed
        from each other many of their arts and crafts, their ideas, customs,
        and institutions. To sift out the elements of culture which a race
        has independently evolved and to distinguish them accurately from
        those which it has derived from other races is a task of extreme
        difficulty and delicacy, which promises to occupy students of man for
        a long time to come; indeed so complex are the facts and so imperfect
        in most cases is the historical record that it may be doubted whether
        in regard to many of the lower races we shall ever arrive at more
        than probable conjectures.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Since the last
        edition of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">The Golden Bough</span></span> was published
        some thirteen years ago, I have seen reason to change my views on
        several matters discussed in this concluding part of the work, and
        though I have called attention to these changes in the text, it may
        be well for the sake of clearness to recapitulate them here.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the first
        place, the arguments of Dr. Edward Westermarck have satisfied me that
        the solar theory of the European fire-festivals, which I accepted
        from W. Mannhardt, is very slightly, if at all, supported by the
        evidence and is probably erroneous. The true explanation of the
        festivals I now believe to be the one advocated by Dr. Westermarck
        himself, namely that they are purificatory in intention, the fire
        being designed not, as I formerly held, to reinforce the sun's light
        and heat by sympathetic magic, but merely to burn or repel the
        noxious things, whether conceived as material or spiritual, which
        threaten the life of man, of animals, and of plants. This aspect of
        the fire-festivals had not wholly escaped me in former editions; I
        pointed it out explicitly, but, biassed perhaps by the great
        authority of Mannhardt, I treated it as secondary and subordinate
        instead of primary and dominant. Out of deference to Mannhardt, for
        whose work I entertain the highest respect, and because the evidence
        for the purificatory theory of the fires is perhaps <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="pageviii">[pg viii]</span><a name="Pgviii" id=
        "Pgviii" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> not quite conclusive, I have in
        this edition repeated and even reinforced the arguments for the solar
        theory of the festivals, so that the reader may see for himself what
        can be said on both sides of the question and may draw his own
        conclusion; but for my part I cannot but think that the arguments for
        the purificatory theory far outweigh the arguments for the solar
        theory. Dr. Westermarck based his criticisms largely on his own
        observations of the Mohammedan fire-festivals of Morocco, which
        present a remarkable resemblance to those of Christian Europe, though
        there seems no reason to assume that herein Africa has borrowed from
        Europe or Europe from Africa. So far as Europe is concerned, the
        evidence tends strongly to shew that the grand evil which the
        festivals aimed at combating was witchcraft, and that they were
        conceived to attain their end by actually burning the witches,
        whether visible or invisible, in the flames. If that was so, the wide
        prevalence and the immense popularity of the fire-festivals provides
        us with a measure for estimating the extent of the hold which the
        belief in witchcraft had on the European mind before the rise of
        Christianity or rather of rationalism; for Christianity, both
        Catholic and Protestant, accepted the old belief and enforced it in
        the old way by the faggot and the stake. It was not until human
        reason at last awoke after the long slumber of the Middle Ages that
        this dreadful obsession gradually passed away like a dark cloud from
        the intellectual horizon of Europe.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Yet we should
        deceive ourselves if we imagined that the belief in witchcraft is
        even now dead in the mass of the people; on the contrary there is
        ample evidence to shew that it only hibernates under the chilling
        influence of rationalism, and that it would start into active life if
        that influence were ever seriously relaxed. The truth seems to be
        that to this day the peasant remains a pagan and savage at heart; his
        civilization is merely a thin veneer which the <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="pageix">[pg ix]</span><a name="Pgix" id="Pgix"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> hard knocks of life soon abrade, exposing
        the solid core of paganism and savagery below. The danger created by
        a bottomless layer of ignorance and superstition under the crust of
        civilized society is lessened, not only by the natural torpidity and
        inertia of the bucolic mind, but also by the progressive decrease of
        the rural as compared with the urban population in modern states; for
        I believe it will be found that the artisans who congregate in towns
        are far less retentive of primitive modes of thought than their
        rustic brethren. In every age cities have been the centres and as it
        were the lighthouses from which ideas radiate into the surrounding
        darkness, kindled by the friction of mind with mind in the crowded
        haunts of men; and it is natural that at these beacons of
        intellectual light all should partake in some measure of the general
        illumination. No doubt the mental ferment and unrest of great cities
        have their dark as well as their bright side; but among the evils to
        be apprehended from them the chances of a pagan revival need hardly
        be reckoned.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another point on
        which I have changed my mind is the nature of the great Aryan god
        whom the Romans called Jupiter and the Greeks Zeus. Whereas I
        formerly argued that he was primarily a personification of the sacred
        oak and only in the second place a personification of the thundering
        sky, I now invert the order of his divine functions and believe that
        he was a sky-god before he came to be associated with the oak. In
        fact, I revert to the traditional view of Jupiter, recant my heresy,
        and am gathered like a lost sheep into the fold of mythological
        orthodoxy. The good shepherd who has brought me back is my friend Mr.
        W. Warde Fowler. He has removed the stone over which I stumbled in
        the wilderness by explaining in a simple and natural way how a god of
        the thundering sky might easily come to be afterwards associated with
        the oak. The explanation turns on the great frequency with which, as
        statistics prove, the oak <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagex">[pg
        x]</span><a name="Pgx" id="Pgx" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> is struck
        by lightning beyond any other tree of the wood in Europe. To our rude
        forefathers, who dwelt in the gloomy depths of the primaeval forest,
        it might well seem that the riven and blackened oaks must indeed be
        favourites of the sky-god, who so often descended on them from the
        murky cloud in a flash of lightning and a crash of thunder.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This change of
        view as to the great Aryan god necessarily affects my interpretation
        of the King of the Wood, the priest of Diana at Aricia, if I may take
        that discarded puppet out of the box again for a moment. On my theory
        the priest represented Jupiter in the flesh, and accordingly, if
        Jupiter was primarily a sky-god, his priest cannot have been a mere
        incarnation of the sacred oak, but must, like the deity whose
        commission he bore, have been invested in the imagination of his
        worshippers with the power of overcasting the heaven with clouds and
        eliciting storms of thunder and rain from the celestial vault. The
        attribution of weather-making powers to kings or priests is very
        common in primitive society, and is indeed one of the principal
        levers by which such personages raise themselves to a position of
        superiority above their fellows. There is therefore no improbability
        in the supposition that as a representative of Jupiter the priest of
        Diana enjoyed this reputation, though positive evidence of it appears
        to be lacking.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Lastly, in the
        present edition I have shewn some grounds for thinking that the
        Golden Bough itself, or in common parlance the mistletoe on the oak,
        was supposed to have dropped from the sky upon the tree in a flash of
        lightning and therefore to contain within itself the seed of
        celestial fire, a sort of smouldering thunderbolt. This view of the
        priest and of the bough which he guarded at the peril of his life has
        the advantage of accounting for the importance which the sanctuary at
        Nemi acquired and the treasure which it amassed through the offerings
        of the faithful; for the shrine would seem to have been to ancient
        what Loreto <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexi">[pg
        xi]</span><a name="Pgxi" id="Pgxi" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> has
        been to modern Italy, a place of pilgrimage, where princes and nobles
        as well as commoners poured wealth into the coffers of Diana in her
        green recess among the Alban hills, just as in modern times kings and
        queens vied with each other in enriching the black Virgin who from
        her Holy House on the hillside at Loreto looks out on the blue
        Adriatic and the purple Apennines. Such pious prodigality becomes
        more intelligible if the greatest of the gods was indeed believed to
        dwell in human shape with his wife among the woods of Nemi.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These are the
        principal points on which I have altered my opinion since the last
        edition of my book was published. The mere admission of such changes
        may suffice to indicate the doubt and uncertainty which attend
        enquiries of this nature. The whole fabric of ancient mythology is so
        foreign to our modern ways of thought, and the evidence concerning it
        is for the most part so fragmentary, obscure, and conflicting that in
        our attempts to piece together and interpret it we can hardly hope to
        reach conclusions that will completely satisfy either ourselves or
        others. In this as in other branches of study it is the fate of
        theories to be washed away like children's castles of sand by the
        rising tide of knowledge, and I am not so presumptuous as to expect
        or desire for mine an exemption from the common lot. I hold them all
        very lightly and have used them chiefly as convenient pegs on which
        to hang my collections of facts. For I believe that, while theories
        are transitory, a record of facts has a permanent value, and that as
        a chronicle of ancient customs and beliefs my book may retain its
        utility when my theories are as obsolete as the customs and beliefs
        themselves deserve to be.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I cannot dismiss
        without some natural regret a task which has occupied and amused me
        at intervals for many years. But the regret is tempered by
        thankfulness and hope. I am thankful that I have been able to
        conclude <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexii">[pg
        xii]</span><a name="Pgxii" id="Pgxii" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> at
        least one chapter of the work I projected a long time ago. I am
        hopeful that I may not now be taking a final leave of my indulgent
        readers, but that, as I am sensible of little abatement in my bodily
        strength and of none in my ardour for study, they will bear with me
        yet a while if I should attempt to entertain them with fresh subjects
        of laughter and tears drawn from the comedy and the tragedy of man's
        endless quest after happiness and truth.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We have
          travelled far since we turned our backs on Nemi and set forth in
          quest of the secret of the Golden Bough. With the present volume we
          enter on the last stage of our long journey. The reader who has had
          the patience to follow the enquiry thus far may remember that at
          the outset two questions were proposed for answer: Why had the
          priest of Aricia to slay his predecessor? And why, before doing so,
          had he to pluck the Golden Bough?<a id="noteref_1" name="noteref_1"
          href="#note_1"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1</span></span></a> Of
          these two questions the first has now been answered. The priest of
          Aricia, if I am right, was one of those sacred kings or human
          divinities on whose life the welfare of the community and even the
          course of nature in general are believed to be intimately
          dependent. It does not appear that the subjects or worshippers of
          such a spiritual potentate form to themselves any very clear notion
          of the exact relationship in which they stand to him; probably
          their ideas on the point are vague and fluctuating, and we should
          err if we attempted to define the relationship with logical
          precision. All that the people know, or rather imagine, is that
          somehow they themselves, their cattle, and their crops are
          mysteriously bound up with their divine king, so that according as
          he is well or ill the community is healthy or sickly, the flocks
          and herds thrive or languish with disease, and the fields yield an
          abundant or a scanty harvest. The worst evil which they can
          conceive of is the natural death of their ruler, whether he succumb
          to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page002">[pg 002]</span><a name=
          "Pg002" id="Pg002" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> sickness or old age,
          for in the opinion of his followers such a death would entail the
          most disastrous consequences on themselves and their possessions;
          fatal epidemics would sweep away man and beast, the earth would
          refuse her increase, nay the very frame of nature itself might be
          dissolved. To guard against these catastrophes it is necessary to
          put the king to death while he is still in the full bloom of his
          divine manhood, in order that his sacred life, transmitted in
          unabated force to his successor, may renew its youth, and thus by
          successive transmissions through a perpetual line of vigorous
          incarnations may remain eternally fresh and young, a pledge and
          security that men and animals shall in like manner renew their
          youth by a perpetual succession of generations, and that seedtime
          and harvest, and summer and winter, and rain and sunshine shall
          never fail. That, if my conjecture is right, was why the priest of
          Aricia, the King of the Wood at Nemi, had regularly to perish by
          the sword of his successor.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It will be well
          to begin by noticing two of those rules or taboos by which, as we
          have seen, the life of divine kings or priests is regulated. The
          first of the rules to which I desire to call the reader's attention
          is that the divine personage may not touch the ground with his
          foot. This rule was observed by the supreme pontiff of the Zapotecs
          in Mexico; he profaned his sanctity if he so much as touched the
          ground with his foot.<a id="noteref_2" name="noteref_2" href=

          Montezuma, emperor of Mexico, never set foot on the ground; he was
          always carried on the shoulders of noblemen, and if he lighted
          anywhere they laid rich tapestry for him to walk upon.<a id=

          "Pg003" id="Pg003" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> degradation; indeed,
          in the sixteenth century, it was enough to deprive him of his
          office. Outside his palace he was carried on men's shoulders;
          within it he walked on exquisitely wrought mats.<a id="noteref_4"

          king and queen of Tahiti might not touch the ground anywhere but
          within their hereditary domains; for the ground on which they trod
          became sacred. In travelling from place to place they were carried
          on the shoulders of sacred men. They were always accompanied by
          several pairs of these sanctified attendants; and when it became
          necessary to change their bearers, the king and queen vaulted on to
          the shoulders of their new bearers without letting their feet touch

          Formerly neither the kings of Uganda, nor their mothers, nor their
          queens might walk on foot outside of the spacious enclosures in
          which they lived. Whenever they went forth they were carried on the
          shoulders of men of the Buffalo clan, several of whom accompanied
          any of these royal personages on a journey and took it in turn to
          bear the burden. The king sat astride the bearer's neck with a leg
          over each shoulder and his feet tucked under the bearer's arms.
          When one of these royal carriers grew tired he shot the king on to
          the shoulders of a second man without allowing the royal feet to
          touch the ground. In this way they went at a great pace and
          travelled long distances in a day, when the king was on a journey.
          The bearers had a special hut in the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          his wristlet. He must abstain from many foods, such as eggs, birds
          of all sorts, mutton, dog, bush-buck, and so forth. He may neither
          wear nor touch a mask, and no masked man may enter his house. If a
          dog enters his house, it is killed and thrown out. As priest of the

          suggested for the rule was that if they touched the earth they
          might make themselves invisible and so escape. The sagacious author
          of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The
          Striped-petticoat Philosophy</span></span> in the eighteenth
          century ridicules the idea as mere silly talk. He admits, indeed,
          that the women were conveyed to the place of execution in carts;
          but he denies that there is any deep significance in the cart, and
          he is prepared to maintain this view by a chemical analysis of the
          timber of which the cart was built. To clinch his argument he
          appeals to plain matter of fact and his own personal experience.
          Not a single instance, he assures us with apparent satisfaction,
          can be produced of a witch who escaped the axe or the fire in this
          fashion. <span class="tei tei-q">“I have myself,”</span> says he,

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Apparently
          holiness, magical virtue, taboo, or whatever we may call that
          mysterious quality which is supposed to pervade sacred or tabooed
          persons, is conceived by the primitive philosopher as a physical
          substance or fluid, with which the sacred man is charged just as a
          Leyden jar is charged with electricity; and exactly as the
          electricity in the jar can be discharged by contact with a good
          conductor, so the holiness or magical virtue in the man can be
          discharged and drained away by contact with the earth, which on
          this theory serves as an excellent conductor for the magical fluid.
          Hence in order to preserve the charge from running to waste, the
          sacred or tabooed personage must be carefully prevented from
          touching the ground; in electrical language he must be insulated,
          if he is not to be emptied of the precious substance or fluid with
          which he, as a vial, is filled to the brim. And in many cases
          apparently the insulation of the tabooed person is recommended as a
          precaution not merely for his own sake but for the sake of others;
          for <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page007">[pg 007]</span><a name=
          "Pg007" id="Pg007" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> since the virtue of
          holiness or taboo is, so to say, a powerful explosive which the
          smallest touch may detonate, it is necessary in the interest of the
          general safety to keep it within narrow bounds, lest breaking out
          it should blast, blight, and destroy whatever it comes into contact
          with.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But things as
          well as persons are often charged with the mysterious quality of
          holiness or taboo; hence it frequently becomes necessary for
          similar reasons to guard them also from coming into contact with
          the ground, lest they should in like manner be drained of their
          valuable properties and be reduced to mere commonplace material
          objects, empty husks from which the good grain has been eliminated.
          Thus, for example, the most sacred object of the Arunta tribe in
          Central Australia is, or rather used to be, a pole about twenty
          feet high, which is completely smeared with human blood, crowned
          with an imitation of a human head, and set up on the ground where
          the final initiatory ceremonies of young men are performed. A young
          gum-tree is chosen to form the pole, and it must be cut down and
          transported in such a way that it does not touch the earth till it
          is erected in its place on the holy ground. Apparently the pole
          represents some famous ancestor of the olden time.<a id=

          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again, at a
          great dancing festival celebrated by the natives of Bartle Bay, in
          British New Guinea, a wild mango tree plays a prominent part. The
          tree must be self-sown, that is, really wild and so young that it
          has never flowered. It is chosen in the jungle some five or six
          weeks before the festival, and a circle is cleared round its trunk.
          From that time the master of the ceremonies and some eight to
          twenty other men, who have aided him in choosing the tree and in
          clearing the jungle, become strictly holy or tabooed. They sleep by
          themselves in a house into which no one else may intrude: they may
          not wash or drink water, nor even allow it accidentally to touch
          their bodies: they are forbidden to eat boiled food and the fruit
          of mango trees: they may drink only the milk of a young coco-nut
          which has been baked, and they may eat certain fruits and
          vegetables, such as paw-paws <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          papaya</span></span>) and sugar-cane, but only on condition that
          they have been baked. All refuse of their food is kept in baskets
          in their sleeping-house and may not be removed from it till the
          festival is over. At the time when the men begin to observe these
          rules of abstinence, some six to ten women, members of the same
          clan as the master of the ceremonies, enter on a like period of
          mortification, avoiding the company of the other sex, and
          refraining from water, all boiled food, and the fruit of the mango
          tree. These fasting men and women are the principal dancers at the
          festival. The dancing takes place on a special platform in a
          temporary village which has been erected for the purpose. When the
          platform is about to be set up, the fasting men rub the stepping
          posts and then suck their hands for the purpose of extracting the
          ghost of any dead man that might chance to be in the post and might
          be injured by the weight of the platform pressing down on him.
          Having carefully extracted these poor souls, the men carry them
          away tenderly and set them free in the forest or the long
          grass.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the day
          before the festival one of the fasting men cuts down the chosen
          mango tree in the jungle with a stone adze, which is never
          afterwards put to any other use; an iron tool may not be used for
          the purpose, though iron tools are now common enough in the
          district. In cutting down the mango they place nets on the ground
          to catch any leaves or twigs that might fall from the tree as it is
          being felled, and they surround the trunk with new mats to receive
          the chips which fly out under the adze of the woodman; for the
          chips may not drop on the earth. Once the tree is down, it is
          carried to the centre of the temporary village, the greatest care
          being taken to prevent it from coming into contact with the ground.
          But when it is brought into the village, the houses are connected
          with the top of the mango by means of long vines decorated with
          streamers. In the afternoon the fasting men and women begin to
          dance, the men bedizened with gay feathers, armlets, streamers, and
          anklets, the women flaunting in parti-coloured petticoats and
          sprigs of croton leaves, which wave from their waistbands as they
          dance. The dancing stops at sundown, and when the full moon rises
          over the shoulder of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page009">[pg

          with reference to the time of the moon), two chiefs mount the
          gables of two houses on the eastern side of the square, and, their
          dusky figures standing sharply out against the moonlight, pray to
          the evil spirits to go away and not to hurt the people. Next
          morning pigs are killed by being speared as slowly as possible in
          order that they may squeal loud and long; for the people believe
          that the mango trees hear the squealing, and are pleased at the
          sound, and bear plenty of fruit, whereas if they heard no squeals
          they would bear no fruit. However, the trees have to content
          themselves with the squeals; the flesh of the pigs is eaten by the
          people. This ends the festival.</p>

          hung from the roof. But after an interval, it may be of many
          months, the tree is brought forth again. As to the reason for its
          reappearance in public opinions are divided; but some say that the
          tree itself orders the master of the ceremonies to bring it forth,
          appearing to him in his dreams and saying, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Let me smell the smoking fat of pigs. So will your
          pigs be healthy and your crops will grow.”</span> Be that as it
          may, out it comes, conducted by the fasting men in their dancing
          costume; and with it come in the solemn procession all the pots,
          spoons, cups and so forth used by the fasting men during their
          period of holiness or taboo, also all the refuse of their food
          which has been collected for months, and all the fallen leaves and
          chips of the mango in their bundles of mats. These holy relics are
          carried in front and the mango tree itself brings up the rear of
          the procession. While these sacred objects are being handed out of
          the house, the men who are present rush up, wipe off the hallowed
          dust which has accumulated on them, and smear it over their own
          bodies, no doubt in order to steep themselves in their blessed
          influence. Thus the tree is carried as before to the centre of the
          temporary village, care being again taken not to let it touch the
          ground. Then one of the fasting men takes from a basket a number of
          young green mangoes, cuts them in pieces, and places them with his
          own hands in the mouths of his fellows, the other <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page010">[pg 010]</span><a name="Pg010" id="Pg010"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> fasting men, who chew the pieces small
          and turning round spit the morsels in the direction of the setting
          sun, in order that <span class="tei tei-q">“the sun should carry
          the mango bits over the whole country and everyone should
          know.”</span> A portion of the mango tree is then broken off and in
          the evening it is burnt along with the bundles of leaves, chips,
          and refuse of food, which have been stored up. What remains of the
          tree is taken to the house of the master of the ceremonies and hung
          over the fire-place; it will be brought out again at intervals and
          burned bit by bit, till all is consumed, whereupon a new mango will
          be cut down and treated in like manner. The ashes of the holy fire
          on each occasion are gathered by the people and preserved in the
          house of the master of the ceremonies.<a id="noteref_22" name=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The meaning of
          these ceremonies is not explained by the authorities who describe
          them; but we may conjecture that they are intended to fertilize the
          mango trees and cause them to bear a good crop of fruit. The
          central feature of the whole ritual is a wild mango tree, so young
          that it has never flowered: the men who cut it down, carry it into
          the village, and dance at the festival, are forbidden to eat
          mangoes: pigs are killed in order that their dying squeals may move
          the mango trees to bear fruit: at the end of the ceremonies pieces
          of young green mangoes are solemnly placed in the mouths of the
          fasting men and are by them spurted out towards the setting sun in
          order that the luminary may carry the fragments to every part of
          the country; and finally when after a longer or shorter interval
          the tree is wholly consumed, its place is supplied by another. All
          these circumstances are explained simply and naturally by the
          supposition that the young mango tree is taken as a representative
          of mangoes generally, that the dances are intended to quicken it,
          and that it is preserved, like a May-pole of old in England, as a
          sort of general fund of vegetable life, till the fund being
          exhausted by the destruction of the tree it is renewed by the
          importation of a fresh young tree from the forest. We can therefore
          understand why, as a storehouse of vital energy, the tree should be
          carefully kept from <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page011">[pg

          or religion by insulating sacred bodies from the ground, the

          the members of which masquerade in petticoats of leaves and tall
          headdresses of wickerwork shaped like candle extinguishers, which
          descend to the shoulders of the wearers, completely concealing

          the ark by turns, but they never set it on the ground nor would
          they themselves sit on the bare earth while they were carrying it
          against the enemy. Where stones were plentiful they rested the ark
          on them; but where no stones were to be found, they deposited it on
          short logs. <span class="tei tei-q">“The Indian ark is deemed so

          which men purchase wives. A square box with a domed top figures
          prominently at the fair. It is fixed on two poles to be carried on
          men's shoulders, and long heavily-plaited petticoats hang from it
          nearly to the ground. Three sides of the box are adorned with the
          head and shoulders of a female figure and the fourth side with a

          his right hand. They dance round, with a swinging rhythmical step,
          to the music of drums and a pipe. The dance goes on for hours and
          is thought to avert ill-luck from the fair. It is said that the box

          their gestures every token of horror. They looked upon their child

          certain glass or paste beads attained great celebrity as amulets
          under the name of serpents' eggs; it was believed that serpents,
          coiling together in a wriggling, writhing mass, generated them from
          their slaver and shot them into the air from their hissing jaws. If
          a man was bold and dexterous enough to catch one of these eggs in
          his cloak before it touched the ground, he rode off on horseback
          with it at full speed, pursued by the whole pack of serpents, till
          he was saved by the interposition of a river, which the snakes
          could not pass. The proof of the egg being genuine was that if it
          were thrown into a stream it would float up against the current,
          even though it were hooped in gold. The Druids held these beads in
          high esteem; according to them, the precious objects could only be
          obtained on a certain day of the moon, and the peculiar virtue that
          resided in them was to secure success in law suits and free access

          lingered, with its immemorial superstitions, down to the present or
          recent times; and the old story of the origin of the beads from the
          slaver of serpents was believed by the modern peasantry of
          Cornwall, Wales, and Scotland as by the Druids of ancient Gaul. In
          Cornwall the time when the serpents united to fashion the beads was
          commonly said to be at or about Midsummer Eve; in Wales it was
          usually thought to be spring, especially the Eve of May Day, and
          even within recent years persons in the Principality have affirmed
          that they witnessed the great <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          magic stone in the midst of the froth. The Welsh peasants believe
          the beads to possess medicinal virtues of many sorts and to be
          particularly efficacious for all maladies of the eyes. In Wales and
          Ireland the beads sometimes went by the name of the Magician's or
          Druid's Glass (<span lang="gd" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
          "gd"><span style="font-style: italic">Gleini na

          xml:lang="gd"><span style="font-style: italic">Glaine nan
          Druidhe</span></span>). Specimens of them may be seen in museums;
          some have been found in British barrows. They are of glass of
          various colours, green, blue, pink, red, brown, and so forth, some
          plain and some ribbed. Some are streaked with brilliant hues. The
          beads are perforated, and in the Highlands of Scotland the hole is
          explained by saying that when the bead has just been conflated by
          the serpents jointly, one of the reptiles sticks his tail through
          the still viscous glass. An Englishman who visited Scotland in 1699
          found many of these beads in use throughout the country. They were
          hung from children's necks to protect them from whooping cough and
          other ailments. Snake Stones were, moreover, a charm to ensure
          prosperity in general and to repel evil spirits. When one of these
          priceless treasures was not on active service, the owner kept it in
          an iron box to guard it against fairies, who, as is well known,
          cannot abide iron.<a id="noteref_40" name="noteref_40" href=

          virtues to rain-water which has fallen on the twenty-seventh day of
          April, Old Style; accordingly they collect it and use it for a
          variety of purposes. Mixed with tar and sprinkled on the door-posts
          it prevents snakes and scorpions from entering the house: sprinkled
          on heaps of threshed corn it protects them from the evil eye: mixed

          the mixture round the trunks of your fig-trees at sunset on
          Midsummer Day, you may depend on it that the trees will bear an
          excellent crop and will not shed their fruit untimely on the
          ground. But in order to preserve these remarkable properties it is
          absolutely essential that the water should on no account be allowed
          to touch the ground; some say too that it should not be exposed to

          is a stalk of oleander with a cluster of four pairs of leaves
          springing from it. They think that the magical virtue is greatest

          plough for the first time in spring, he called in a wizard to
          perform a certain ceremony for the good of the crops. The sage
          seized a mug of beer with his teeth, quaffed the liquor, and then
          tossed the mug over his head. This signified that the corn in that
          year should grow taller than a man. But the mug might not fall to
          the ground; it had to be caught by somebody stationed at the
          wizard's back, for if it fell to the ground the consequence
          naturally would be that the corn also would be laid low on the

          river and hides herself among the reeds for the day, so as not to
          be seen by men. She covers her head carefully with her blanket that
          the sun may not shine on it and shrivel her up into a withered
          skeleton, as would result from exposure to the sun's beams. After

          avoidance is assigned by the A-Kamba of British East Africa, whose
          girls under similar circumstances observe the same rule.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“A girl's first menstruation is a very
          critical period of her life according to A-Kamba beliefs. If this
          condition appears when she is away from the village, say at work in
          the fields, she returns at once to her village, but is careful to
          walk through the grass and not on a path, for if she followed a
          path and a stranger accidentally trod on a spot of blood and then
          cohabited with a member of the opposite sex before the girl was
          better again, it is believed that she would never bear a
          child.”</span> She remains at home till the symptoms have ceased,
          and during this time she may be fed by none but her mother. When
          the flux is over, her father and mother are bound to cohabit with
          each other, else it is believed that the girl would be barren all
          her life.<a id="noteref_67" name="noteref_67" href=
          "#note_67"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          Similarly, among the Baganda, when a girl menstruated for the first
          time she was secluded and not allowed to handle food; and at the
          end of her seclusion the kinsman with whom she was staying (for
          among the Baganda young people did not reside with their parents)
          was obliged to jump over his wife, which with the Baganda is
          regarded as equivalent to having intercourse with her. Should the
          girl happen to be living near her parents at the moment when she
          attained to puberty, she was expected on her recovery to inform
          them of the fact, whereupon her father jumped over her mother. Were
          this custom omitted, the Baganda, like the A-Kamba, thought that
          the girl would never have children or that they would die in
          infancy.<a id="noteref_68" name="noteref_68" href=
          "#note_68"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          024]</span><a name="Pg024" id="Pg024" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          the girl was a magical ceremony to ensure her fertility. It is
          significant that among the Baganda the first menstruation was often
          called a marriage, and the girl was spoken of as a bride.<a id=

          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">69</span></span></a> These
          terms so applied point to a belief like that of the Siamese, that a
          girl's first menstruation results from her defloration by one of a
          host of aerial spirits, and that the wound thus inflicted is
          repeated afterwards every month by the same ghostly agency.<a id=

          like reason, probably, the Baganda imagine that a woman who does
          not menstruate exerts a malign influence on gardens and makes them
          barren<a id="noteref_71" name="noteref_71" href=

          can she fertilize the garden?</p>

          Towards sunset one of the older women—who, as directress of the
          ceremonies, is called <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

          the girl is carried on the old woman's back to her mother's hut.
          When the customary period of a few days has elapsed, she is allowed
          to cook again, after first whitewashing the floor of the hut. But,
          by the following month, the preparations for her initiation are
          complete. The novice must remain in her hut throughout the whole
          period of initiation, and is carefully guarded by the old women,

          head with a native cloth. The ceremonies last for at least one

          are kept up within the mother's hut by the village women, and no

          The directress of the rites and the older women instruct the

          illustrated by mud figures of animals and of the common objects of
          domestic life. Moreover, the directress of studies embellishes the

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Among the
          Nyanja-speaking tribes of Central Angoniland, in British Central
          Africa, when a young girl finds that she has become a woman, she
          stands silent by the pathway leading to the village, her face wrapt
          in her calico. An old woman, finding her there, takes her off to a
          stream to bathe; after that the girl is secluded for six days in
          the old woman's hut. She eats her porridge out of an old basket and
          her relish, in which no salt is put, from a potsherd. The basket is
          afterwards thrown away. On the seventh day the aged matrons gather
          together, go with the girl to a stream, and throw her into the
          water. In returning they sing songs, and the old woman, who directs
          the proceedings, carries the maiden on her back. Then they spread a
          mat and fetch her husband and set the two down on the mat and shave
          his head. When it is dark, the old women escort the girl to her
          husband's hut. There the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">ndiwo</span></span> relish is cooking on the
          fire. During the night the woman rises and puts some salt in the
          pot. Next morning, before dawn, while all is dark and the villagers
          have not yet opened their doors, the young married woman goes off
          and gives some of the relish to her mother and to the old woman who
          was mistress of the ceremony. This relish she sets down at the
          doors of their <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page026">[pg
          026]</span><a name="Pg026" id="Pg026" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          houses and goes away. And in the morning, when the sun has risen
          and all is light in the village, the two women open their doors,
          and there they find the relish with the salt in it; and they take
          of it and rub it on their feet and under their arm-pits; and if
          there are little children in the house, they eat of it. And if the
          young wife has a kinsman who is absent from the village, some of
          the relish is put on a splinter of bamboo and kept against his
          return, that when he comes he, too, may rub his feet with it. But
          if the woman finds that her husband is impotent, she does not rise
          betimes and go out in the dark to lay the relish at the doors of
          her mother and the old woman. And in the morning, when the sun is
          up and all the village is light, the old women open their doors,
          and see no relish there, and they know what has happened, and so
          they go wilily to work. For they persuade the husband to consult
          the diviner that he may discover how to cure his impotence; and
          while he is closeted with the wizard, they fetch another man, who
          finishes the ceremony with the young wife, in order that the relish
          may be given out and that people may rub their feet with it. But if
          it happens that when a girl comes to maturity she is not yet
          betrothed to any man, and therefore has no husband to go to, the
          matrons tell her that she must go to a lover instead. And this is
          the custom which they call <span class=

          takes her cooking pot and relish and hies away to the quarters of
          the young bachelors, and they very civilly sleep somewhere else
          that night. And in the morning the girl goes back to the

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From the
          foregoing account it appears that among these tribes no sooner has
          a girl attained to womanhood than she is expected and indeed
          required to give proof of her newly acquired powers by cohabiting
          with a man, whether her husband or another. And the abstinence from
          salt during the girl's seclusion is all the more remarkable because
          as soon as the seclusion is over she has to use salt for a
          particular purpose, to which the people evidently attach very great
          importance, since in the event of her husband proving impotent she
          is even compelled, apparently, to commit <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page027">[pg 027]</span><a name="Pg027" id="Pg027" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> adultery in order that the salted relish may
          be given out as usual. In this connexion it deserves to be noted
          that among the Wagogo of German East Africa women at their monthly
          periods may not sleep with their husbands and may not put salt in
          food.<a id="noteref_74" name="noteref_74" href=
          "#note_74"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">74</span></span></a> A
          similar rule is observed by the Nyanja-speaking tribes of Central
          Angoniland, with whose puberty customs we are here concerned. Among
          them, we are told, <span class="tei tei-q">“some superstition
          exists with regard to the use of salt. A woman during her monthly
          sickness must on no account put salt into any food she is cooking,
          lest she give her husband or children a disease called <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=

          "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">chitsoko

          song goes, <span class="tei tei-q">‘<span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Natira mchere ni
          bondo chifukwa n'kupanda mwana</span></span>,’</span> and pours in
          the salt by placing it on her knee, because there is no child
          handy. Should a party of villagers have gone to make salt, all
          sexual intercourse is forbidden among the people of the village,
          until the people who have gone to make the salt (from grass)
          return. When they do come back, they must make their entry into the
          village at night, and no one must see them. Then one of the elders
          of the village sleeps with his wife. She then cooks some relish,
          into which she puts some of the salt. This relish is handed round
          to the people who went to make the salt, who rub it on their feet
          and under their armpits.”</span><a id="noteref_75" name=

          it would seem that in the mind of these people abstinence from salt
          is somehow associated with the idea of chastity. The same
          association meets us in the customs of many peoples in various
          parts of the world. For example, ancient Hindoo ritual prescribed
          that for three nights after a husband had brought his bride home,
          the two should sleep on the ground, remain chaste, and eat no
          salt.<a id="noteref_76" name="noteref_76" href=
          "#note_76"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">76</span></span></a> Among
          the Baganda, when a man was making a net, he had to refrain from
          eating salt and meat and from living with his wife; these
          restrictions he observed until the net took its first catch of
          fish. Similarly, so long as a fisherman's nets or traps were in the
          water, he must live apart from his wife, and neither he nor she nor
          their children might eat salt or <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          Evidence of the same sort could be multiplied,<a id="noteref_78"

          without going into it further we may say that for some reason which
          is not obvious to us primitive man connects salt with the
          intercourse of the sexes and therefore forbids the use of that
          condiment in a variety of circumstances in which he deems
          continence necessary or desirable. As there is nothing which the
          savage regards as a greater bar between the sexes than the state of
          menstruation, he naturally prohibits the use of salt to women and
          girls at their monthly periods.</p>

          with a few companions of her own sex, in a darkened house. The
          floor is covered with dry banana leaves, but no fire may be lit in
          the house, which is called <span class="tei tei-q">“the house of

          at which they make a noise with a peculiar kind of rattle. After

          (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

          special compartment screened off from the men's quarters. She may
          not cut her hair or touch food, but is fed by other women. At
          night, however, she quits the hut and dances with young men.<a id=

          home late and starting before dawn in order not to be seen by the
          men. The women of the village visit her, bringing food and honey,
          and singing and dancing to amuse her. At the end of a month her

          home only by night is a fear, not so much lest she should be seen
          by men, as that she might be seen by the sun. Among the Wafiomi, as
          we have just learned, the young woman in similar circumstances is
          even free to dance with men, provided always that the dance is
          danced at night. The ceremonies among the Barotse or Marotse are
          somewhat more elaborate for a girl of the royal family. She is shut
          up for three months in a place which is kept secret from the
          public; only the women of her family know where it is. There she
          sits alone in the darkness of the hut, waited on by female slaves,
          who are strictly forbidden to speak and may communicate with her
          and with each other only by signs. During all this time, though she
          does nothing, she eats much, and when at last she comes forth, her
          appearance is quite changed, so fat has she grown. She is then led
          by night to the river and bathed in presence of all the women of
          the village. Next day she flaunts before the public in her gayest
          attire, her head bedecked with ornaments and her face mottled with
          red paint. So everybody knows what has happened.<a id="noteref_82"

          Delagoa Bay, when a girl thinks that the time of her nubility is
          near, she chooses an adoptive mother, perhaps in a neighbouring
          village. When the symptoms appear, she flies away from her own
          village and repairs to that of her adopted mother <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“to weep near her.”</span> After that she is secluded
          with several other girls in the same condition for a month. They
          are shut up in a hut, and whenever they come outside they must wear
          a dirty greasy cloth over their faces as a veil. Every morning they
          are led to a pool and plunged in the water up to their necks.
          Initiated girls or women accompany them, singing obscene songs and
          driving away with sticks any man who meets them; for no man may see
          a girl during this time of seclusion. If he saw her, it is said
          that he would be struck blind. On their return from the river, the
          girls are again imprisoned in the hut, where they remain wet and
          shivering, for they may not go near the fire to warm themselves.
          During their seclusion they listen to lascivious songs sung by
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page030">[pg 030]</span><a name=

          forbidden to drink milk all the days of her separation, she washes
          out her mouth with milk, and is from that moment regarded as a

          the girl is a chief's daughter the ceremonies at her liberation
          from the hut are more elaborate than usual. She is led forth from
          the hut by a son of her father's councillor, who, wearing the wings
          of a blue crane, the badge of bravery, on his head, escorts her to
          the cattle kraal, where cows are slaughtered and dancing takes
          place. Large skins full of milk are sent to the spot from
          neighbouring villages; and after the dances are over the girl
          drinks milk for the first time since the day she entered into
          retreat. But the first mouthful is drunk by the girl's aunt or
          other female relative who had charge of her during her seclusion;
          and a little of it is poured on the fire-place.<a id="noteref_87"

          Amongst the Zulus, when the girl was a princess royal, the end of
          her time of separation was celebrated by a sort of saturnalia: law
          and order were for the time being in abeyance: every man, woman,
          and child might appropriate any article of property: the king
          abstained from interfering; and if during this reign of misrule he
          was robbed of anything he valued he could only <span class=

          matrons in a river, they are hidden separately in the turns and
          bends of the stream, and told to cover their heads, as they will be
          visited by a large serpent. Their limbs are then plastered with
          clay, little masks of straw are put on their faces, and thus
          arrayed they daily follow each other in procession, singing
          melancholy airs, to the fields, there to learn the labours of
          husbandry in which a great part of their adult life will be
          passed.<a id="noteref_89" name="noteref_89" href=

          suppose, though we are not told, that the straw masks which they

          seclusion in a small hut built for the purpose. The hair of her
          head is shaved off, and every day the whole of her body is smeared

          loaded with brass rings, and she is led in solemn procession under
          an umbrella to her husband's house. If these ceremonies were not

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In New Ireland
          girls are confined for four or five years in small cages, being
          kept in the dark and not allowed to set foot on the ground. The
          custom has been thus described by an eye-witness. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I heard from a teacher about some strange custom
          connected with some of the young girls here, so I asked the chief
          to take me to the house where they were. The house was about
          twenty-five feet in length, and stood in a reed and bamboo
          enclosure, across the entrance to which a bundle of dried grass was
          suspended to show that it was strictly <span class=
          "tei tei-q">‘<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">tabu</span></span>.’</span> Inside the house
          were three conical structures about seven or eight feet in height,
          and about ten or twelve feet in circumference at the bottom, and
          for about four feet from the ground, at which point they tapered
          off to a point at the top. These cages were made of the broad
          leaves of the pandanus-tree, sewn quite close together so that no
          light and little or no air could enter. On one side of each is an
          opening which is closed by a double door of plaited cocoa-nut tree
          and pandanus-tree leaves. About three feet from the ground there is
          a stage of bamboos which forms the floor. In each of these cages we
          were told there was a young woman confined, each of whom had to
          remain for at least four or five years, without ever being allowed
          to go outside the house. I could scarcely credit the story when I
          heard it; the whole thing seemed too horrible to be true. I spoke
          to the chief, and told him that I wished to see the inside of the
          cages, and also to see the girls that I might make them a present
          of a few beads. He told me that it was <span class=
          "tei tei-q">‘<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">tabu</span></span>,’</span> forbidden for any
          men but their own relations to look at them; but I suppose the
          promised beads <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page033">[pg
          033]</span><a name="Pg033" id="Pg033" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          acted as an inducement, and so he sent away for some old lady who
          had charge, and who alone is allowed to open the doors. While we
          were waiting we could hear the girls talking to the chief in a
          querulous way as if objecting to something or expressing their
          fears. The old woman came at length and certainly she did not seem
          a very pleasant jailor or guardian; nor did she seem to favour the
          request of the chief to allow us to see the girls, as she regarded
          us with anything but pleasant looks. However, she had to undo the
          door when the chief told her to do so, and then the girls peeped
          out at us, and, when told to do so, they held out their hands for
          the beads. I, however, purposely sat at some distance away and
          merely held out the beads to them, as I wished to draw them quite
          outside, that I might inspect the inside of the cages. This desire
          of mine gave rise to another difficulty, as these girls were not
          allowed to put their feet to the ground all the time they were
          confined in these places. However, they wished to get the beads,
          and so the old lady had to go outside and collect a lot of pieces
          of wood and bamboo, which she placed on the ground, and then going
          to one of the girls, she helped her down and held her hand as she
          stepped from one piece of wood to another until she came near
          enough to get the beads I held out to her. I then went to inspect
          the inside of the cage out of which she had come, but could
          scarcely put my head inside of it, the atmosphere was so hot and
          stifling. It was clean and contained nothing but a few short
          lengths of bamboo for holding water. There was only room for the
          girl to sit or lie down in a crouched position on the bamboo
          platform, and when the doors are shut it must be nearly or quite
          dark inside. The girls are never allowed to come out except once a
          day to bathe in a dish or wooden bowl placed close to each cage.
          They say that they perspire profusely. They are placed in these
          stifling cages when quite young, and must remain there until they
          are young women, when they are taken out and have each a great
          marriage feast provided for them. One of them was about fourteen or
          fifteen years old, and the chief told us that she had been there
          for five years, but would soon be taken out now. The other two were
          about eight and ten years old, and they have to stay there for
          several years <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page034">[pg

          recent observer has described the custom as it is observed on the
          western coast of New Ireland. He says: <span class="tei tei-q">“A
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

          house, not larger than an ordinary hen-coop, in which a little girl
          is shut up, sometimes for weeks only, and at other times for
          months.... Briefly stated, the custom is this. Girls, on attaining
          puberty or betrothal, are enclosed in one of these little coops for
          a considerable time. They must remain there night and day. We saw
          two of these girls in two coops; the girls were not more than ten
          years old, still they were lying in a doubled-up position, as their
          little houses would not admit of them lying in any other way. These
          two coops were inside a large house; but the chief, in
          consideration of a present of a couple of tomahawks, ordered the
          ends to be torn out of the house to admit the light, so that we
          might photograph the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

          five or six weeks in an inner part of the house; but she may not
          sit on the floor, lest her uncleanness should cleave to it, so a
          log of wood is placed for her to squat on. Moreover, she may not
          touch the ground with her feet; hence if she is obliged to quit the
          house for a short time, she is muffled up in mats and walks on two
          halves of a coco-nut shell, which are fastened like sandals to her
          feet by creeping plants. During her seclusion she is in charge of
          her aunts or other female relatives. At the end of the time she
          bathes, her person is loaded with ornaments, her face is
          grotesquely painted with red stripes on a white ground, and thus
          adorned she is brought forth in public to be admired by everybody.

          shut up in a little room or cell of the house, and cut off from all
          intercourse with the world for a long time. The cell, like the rest
          of the house, is raised on piles above the ground, and is lit by a
          single small window opening on a lonely place, so that the girl is
          in almost total darkness. She may not leave the room on any pretext
          whatever, not even for the most necessary purposes. None of her
          family may see her all the time she is shut up, but a single slave
          woman is appointed to wait on her. During her lonely confinement,
          which often lasts seven years, the girl occupies herself in weaving
          mats or with other handiwork. Her bodily growth is stunted by the
          long want of exercise, and <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          the earth, the water, the trees, and the flowers, as if she were
          newly born. Then a great feast is made, a slave is killed, and the

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the island of
          Mabuiag, Torres Straits, when the signs of puberty appear on a
          girl, a circle of bushes is made in a dark corner of the house.
          Here, decked with shoulder-belts, armlets, leglets just below the
          knees, and anklets, wearing a chaplet on her head, and shell
          ornaments in her ears, on her chest, and on her back, she squats in
          the midst of the bushes, which are piled so high round about her
          that only her head is visible. In this state of seclusion she must
          remain for three months. All this time the sun may not shine upon
          her, but at night she is allowed to slip out of the hut, and the
          bushes that hedge her in are then changed. She may not feed herself
          or handle food, but is fed by one or two old women, her maternal
          aunts, who are especially appointed to look after her. One of these
          women cooks food for her at a special fire in the forest. The girl
          is forbidden to eat turtle or <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page037">[pg 037]</span><a name="Pg037" id="Pg037" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> turtle eggs during the season when the
          turtles are breeding; but no vegetable food is refused her. No man,
          not even her own father, may come into the house while her
          seclusion lasts; for if her father saw her at this time he would
          certainly have bad luck in his fishing, and would probably smash
          his canoe the very next time he went out in it. At the end of the
          three months she is carried down to a fresh-water creek by her
          attendants, hanging on to their shoulders in such a way that her
          feet do not touch the ground, while the women of the tribe form a
          ring round her, and thus escort her to the beach. Arrived at the
          shore, she is stripped of her ornaments, and the bearers stagger
          with her into the creek, where they immerse her, and all the other
          women join in splashing water over both the girl and her bearers.
          When they come out of the water one of the two attendants makes a
          heap of grass for her charge to squat upon. The other runs to the
          reef, catches a small crab, tears off its claws, and hastens back
          with them to the creek. Here in the meantime a fire has been
          kindled, and the claws are roasted at it. The girl is then fed by
          her attendants with the roasted claws. After that she is freshly
          decorated, and the whole party marches back to the village in a
          single rank, the girl walking in the centre between her two old
          aunts, who hold her by the wrists. The husbands of her aunts now
          receive her and lead her into the house of one of them, where all
          partake of food, and the girl is allowed once more to feed herself
          in the usual manner. A dance follows, in which the girl takes a
          prominent part, dancing between the husbands of the two aunts who
          had charge of her in her retirement.<a id="noteref_99" name=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Among the
          Yaraikanna tribe of Cape York Peninsula, in Northern Queensland, a
          girl at puberty is said to live by herself for a month or six
          weeks; no man may see her, though any woman may. She stays in a hut
          or shelter specially made for her, on the floor of which she lies
          supine. She may not see the sun, and towards sunset she must keep
          her eyes shut until the sun has gone down, otherwise it is thought
          that her nose will be diseased. During her seclusion <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page038">[pg 038]</span><a name="Pg038" id="Pg038"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> she may eat nothing that lives in salt
          water, or a snake would kill her. An old woman waits upon her and
          supplies her with roots, yams, and water.<a id="noteref_100" name=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">100</span></span></a> Some
          tribes are wont to bury their girls at such seasons more or less
          deeply in the ground, perhaps in order to hide them from the light
          of the sun. Thus the Larrakeeyah tribe in the northern territory of
          South Australia used to cover a girl up with dirt for three days at
          her first monthly period.<a id="noteref_101" name="noteref_101"

          similar circumstances the Otati tribe, on the east coast of the
          Cape York Peninsula, make an excavation in the ground, where the
          girl squats. A bower is then built over the hole, and sand is
          thrown on the young woman till she is covered up to the hips. In
          this condition she remains for the first day, but comes out at
          night. So long as the period lasts, she stays in the bower during
          the day-time, but is not again covered with sand. Afterwards her
          body is painted red and white from the head to the hips, and she
          returns to the camp, where she squats first on the right side, then
          on the left side, and then on the lap of her future husband, who
          has been previously selected for her.<a id="noteref_102" name=

          the natives of the Pennefather River, in the Cape York Peninsula,
          Queensland, when a girl menstruates for the first time, her mother
          takes her away from the camp to some secluded spot, where she digs
          a circular hole in the sandy soil under the shade of a tree. In
          this hole the girl squats with crossed legs and is covered with
          sand from the waist downwards. A digging-stick is planted firmly in
          the sand on each side of her, and the place is surrounded by a
          fence of bushes except in front, where her mother kindles a fire.
          Here the girl stays all day, sitting with her arms crossed and the
          palms of her hands resting on the sand. She may not move her arms
          except to take food from her mother or to scratch herself; and in
          scratching herself she may not touch herself with her own hands,
          but must use for the purpose a splinter of wood, which, when it is
          not in use, is stuck in her hair. She may speak to nobody but her
          mother; indeed nobody else would <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page039">[pg 039]</span><a name="Pg039" id="Pg039" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> think of coming near her. At evening she lays
          hold of the two digging-sticks and by their help frees herself from
          the superincumbent weight of sand and returns to the camp. Next
          morning she is again buried in the sand under the shade of the tree
          and remains there again till evening. This she does daily for five
          days. On her return at evening on the fifth day her mother
          decorates her with a waist-band, a forehead-band, and a necklet of
          pearl-shell, ties green parrot feathers round her arms and wrists
          and across her chest, and smears her body, back and front, from the
          waist upwards with blotches of red, white, and yellow paint. She
          has in like manner to be buried in the sand at her second and third
          menstruations, but at the fourth she is allowed to remain in camp,
          only signifying her condition by wearing a basket of empty shells
          on her back.<a id="noteref_103" name="noteref_103" href=

          the Kia blacks of the Prosperine River, on the east coast of
          Queensland, a girl at puberty has to sit or lie down in a shallow
          pit away from the camp; a rough hut of bushes is erected over her
          to protect her from the inclemency of the weather. There she stays
          for about a week, waited on by her mother and sister, the only
          persons to whom she may speak. She is allowed to drink water, but
          may not touch it with her hands; and she may scratch herself a
          little with a mussel-shell. This seclusion is repeated at her
          second and third monthly periods, but when the third is over she is
          brought to her husband bedecked with savage finery. Eagle-hawk or
          cockatoo feathers are stuck in her hair: a shell hangs over her
          forehead: grass bugles encircle her neck and an apron of opossum
          skin her waist: strings are tied to her arms and wrists; and her
          whole body is mottled with patterns drawn in red, white, and yellow
          pigments and charcoal.<a id="noteref_104" name="noteref_104" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Among the
          Uiyumkwi tribe in Red Island the girl lies at full length in a
          shallow trench dug in the foreshore, and sand is lightly thrown
          over her legs and body up to the breasts, which appear not to be
          covered. A rough shelter of boughs is then built over her, and thus
          she <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page040">[pg 040]</span><a name=
          "Pg040" id="Pg040" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> remains lying for a
          few hours. Then she and her attendant go into the bush and look for
          food, which they cook at a fire close to the shelter. They sleep
          under the boughs, the girl remaining secluded from the camp but
          apparently not being again buried. At the end of the symptoms she
          stands over hot stones and water is poured over her, till,
          trickling from her body on the stones, it is converted into steam
          and envelops her in a cloud of vapour. Then she is painted with red
          and white stripes and returns to the camp. If her future husband
          has already been chosen, she goes to him and they eat some food
          together, which the girl has previously brought from the
          bush.<a id="noteref_105" name="noteref_105" href=

          Prince of Wales Island, Torres Strait, the treatment of the patient
          is similar, but lasts for about two months. During the day she lies
          covered up with sand in a shallow hole on the beach, over which a
          hut is built. At night she may get out of the hole, but she may not
          leave the hut. Her paternal aunt looks after her, and both of them
          must abstain from eating turtle, dugong, and the heads of fish.
          Were they to eat the heads of fish no more fish would be caught.
          During the time of the girl's seclusion, the aunt who waits upon
          her has the right to enter any house and take from it anything she
          likes without payment, provided she does so before the sun rises.
          When the time of her retirement has come to an end, the girl bathes
          in the sea while the morning star is rising, and after performing
          various other ceremonies is readmitted to society.<a id=

          Saibai, another island of Torres Straits, at her first monthly
          sickness a girl lives secluded in the forest for about a fortnight,
          during which no man may see her; even the women who have spoken to
          her in the forest must wash in salt water before they speak to a
          man. Two girls wait upon and feed the damsel, putting the food into
          her mouth, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page041">[pg

          for she is not allowed to touch it with her own hands. Nor may she
          eat dugong and turtle. At the end of a fortnight the girl and her
          attendants bathe in salt water while the tide is running out.
          Afterwards they are clean, may again speak to men without ceremony,
          and move freely about the village. In Yam and Tutu a girl at
          puberty retires for a month to the forest, where no man nor even
          her own mother may look upon her. She is waited on by women who

          aunts. She is blackened all over with charcoal and wears a long
          petticoat reaching below her knees. During her seclusion the
          married women of the village often assemble in the forest and
          dance, and the girl's aunts relieve the tedium of the proceedings
          by thrashing her from time to time as a useful preparation for
          matrimony. At the end of a month the whole party go into the sea,

          decorated, her body blackened again, her hair reddened with ochre,

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Among the
          Indians of California a girl at her first menstruation <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“was thought to be possessed of a particular degree of
          supernatural power, and this was not always regarded as entirely
          defiling or malevolent. Often, however, there was a strong feeling
          of the power of evil inherent in her condition. Not only was she
          secluded from her family and the community, but an attempt was made
          to seclude the world from her. One of the injunctions most strongly
          laid upon her was not to look about her. She kept her head bowed
          and was forbidden to see the world and the sun. Some tribes covered
          her with a blanket. Many of the customs in this connection
          resembled those of the North Pacific Coast most strongly, such as
          the prohibition to the girl to touch or scratch her head with her
          hand, a special implement being furnished her for the purpose.
          Sometimes <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page042">[pg
          042]</span><a name="Pg042" id="Pg042" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          she could eat only when fed and in other cases fasted altogether.
          Some form of public ceremony, often accompanied by a dance and
          sometimes by a form of ordeal for the girl, was practised nearly
          everywhere. Such ceremonies were well developed in Southern
          California, where a number of actions symbolical of the girl's
          maturity and subsequent life were performed.”</span><a id=

          among the Maidu Indians of California a girl at puberty remained
          shut up in a small separate hut. For five days she might not eat
          flesh or fish nor feed herself, but was fed by her mother or other
          old woman. She had a basket, plate, and cup for her own use, and a
          stick with which to scratch her head, for she might not scratch it
          with her fingers. At the end of five days she took a warm bath and,
          while she still remained in the hut and plied the scratching-stick
          on her head, was privileged to feed herself with her own hands.
          After five days more she bathed in the river, after which her
          parents gave a great feast in her honour. At the feast the girl was
          dressed in her best, and anybody might ask her parents for anything
          he pleased, and they had to give it, even if it was the hand of
          their daughter in marriage. During the period of her seclusion in
          the hut the girl was allowed to go by night to her parents' house
          and listen to songs sung by her friends and relations, who
          assembled for the purpose. Among the songs were some that related
          to the different roots and seeds which in these tribes it is the
          business of women to gather for food. While the singers sang, she
          sat by herself in a corner of the house muffled up completely in
          mats and skins; no man or boy might come near her.<a id=

          reached maturity her male relatives danced all night for nine

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Among the Haida
          Indians of the Queen Charlotte Islands girls at puberty were
          secluded behind screens in the house for about twenty days. In some
          parts of the islands separate fires were provided for the girls,
          and they went out and in by a separate door at the back of the
          house. If a girl at such a time was obliged to go out by the front
          door, all the weapons, gambling-sticks, medicine, and other
          articles had to be removed from the house till her return, for
          otherwise it was thought that they would be unlucky; and if there
          was a good hunter in the house, he also had to go out at the same
          time on pain of losing his good luck if he remained. During several
          months or even half a year the girl was bound to wear a peculiar
          cloak or hood made of cedar-bark, nearly conical in shape and
          reaching <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page045">[pg
          045]</span><a name="Pg045" id="Pg045" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          down below the breast, but open before the face. After the twenty
          days were over the girl took a bath; none of the water might be
          spilled, it had all to be taken back to the woods, else the girl
          would not live long. On the west coast of the islands the damsel
          might eat nothing but black cod for four years; for the people
          believed that other kinds of fish would become scarce if she
          partook of them. At Kloo the young woman at such times was
          forbidden to look at the sea, and for forty days she might not gaze
          at the fire; for a whole year she might not walk on the beach below
          high-water mark, because then the tide would come in, covering part
          of the food supply, and there would be bad weather. For five years
          she might not eat salmon, or the fish would be scarce; and when her
          family went to a salmon-creek, she landed from the canoe at the
          mouth of the creek and came to the smoke-house from behind; for
          were she to see a salmon leap, all the salmon might leave the
          creek. Among the Haidas of Masset it was believed that if the girl
          looked at the sky, the weather would be bad, and that if she
          stepped over a salmon-creek, all the salmon would disappear.<a id=

          air-hole. In this dark and filthy abode she had to remain a year,
          without fire, exercise, or associates. Only her mother and a female
          slave might supply her with nourishment. Her food was put in at the
          little window; she had to drink out of the wing-bone of a
          white-headed eagle. The time of her seclusion was afterwards
          reduced in some places to six or three months or even less. She had
          to wear a sort of hat with long flaps, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          imagined that her look would destroy the luck of a hunter, fisher,
          or gambler, turn things to stone, and do other mischief. At the end
          of her confinement her old clothes were burnt, new ones were made,
          and a feast was given, at which a slit was cut in her under lip

          about one inch wide across their eyes, and wear a fringe of shells,
          bones, etc., hanging down from their foreheads to below their eyes;
          and this is never taken off <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page048">[pg 048]</span><a name="Pg048" id="Pg048" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> till the second monthly period arrives and
          ceases, when the nearest male relative makes a feast; after which
          she is considered a fully matured woman; but she has to refrain
          from eating anything fresh for one year after her first monthly
          sickness; she may however eat partridge, but it must be cooked in
          the crop of the bird to render it harmless. I would have thought it
          impossible to perform this feat had I not seen it done. The crop is
          blown out, and a small bent willow put round the mouth; it is then
          filled with water, and the meat being first minced up, put in also,
          then put on the fire and boiled till cooked. Their reason for
          hanging fringes before their eyes, is to hinder any bad medicine
          man from harming them during this critical period: they are very
          careful not to drink whilst facing a medicine man, and do so only
          when their backs are turned to him. All these habits are left off
          when the girl is a recognised woman, with the exception of their
          going out of the lodge and remaining in a hut, every time their
          periodical sickness comes on. This is a rigidly observed law with
          both single and married women.”</span><a id="noteref_120" name=

          tube made from a swan's bone, and for a month she might not break a

          the Tinneh Indians of the middle Yukon valley, in Alaska, the
          period of the girl's seclusion lasts exactly a lunar month; for the
          day of the moon on which the symptoms first occur is noted, and she
          is sequestered until the same day of the next moon. If the season
          is winter, a corner of the house is curtained off for her use by a
          blanket or a sheet of canvas; if it is summer, a small tent is
          erected for her near the common one. Here she lives and sleeps. She
          wears a long robe and a large <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page049">[pg 049]</span><a name="Pg049" id="Pg049" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> hood, which she must pull down over her eyes
          whenever she leaves the hut, and she must keep it down till she
          returns. She may not speak to a man nor see his face, much less
          touch his clothes or anything that belongs to him; for if she did
          so, though no harm would come to her, he would grow unmanly. She
          has her own dishes for eating out of and may use no other; at
          Kaltag she must suck the water through a swan's bone without
          applying her lips to the cup. She may eat no fresh meat or fish
          except the flesh of the porcupine. She may not undress, but sleeps
          with all her clothes on, even her mittens. In her socks she wears,
          next to the skin, the horny soles cut from the feet of a porcupine,
          in order that for the rest of her life her shoes may never wear
          out. Round her waist she wears a cord to which are tied the heads
          of femurs of a porcupine; because of all animals known to the
          Tinneh the porcupine suffers least in parturition, it simply drops
          its young and continues to walk or skip about as if nothing had
          happened. Hence it is easy to see that a girl who wears these
          portions of a porcupine about her waist, will be delivered just as
          easily as the animal. To make quite sure of this, if anybody
          happens to kill a porcupine big with young while the girl is
          undergoing her period of separation, the foetus is given to her,
          and she lets it slide down between her shirt and her body so as to
          fall on the ground like an infant.<a id="noteref_122" name=

          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Among the
          Thompson Indians of British Columbia, when a girl attained puberty,
          she was at once separated from all the people. A conical hut of fir
          branches and bark was erected at some little distance from the
          other houses, and in it the girl had to squat on her heels during
          the day. Often a deep circular hole was dug in the hut and the girl
          squatted in the hole, with her head projecting above the surface of
          the ground. She might quit the hut for various purposes in the
          early morning, but had always to be back at sunrise. On the first
          appearance of the symptoms her face was <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page050">[pg 050]</span><a name="Pg050" id="Pg050" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> painted red all over, and the paint was
          renewed every morning during her term of seclusion. A heavy blanket
          swathed her body from top to toe, and during the first four days
          she wore a conical cap made of small fir branches, which reached
          below the breast but left an opening for the face. In her hair was
          fastened an implement made of deer-bone with which she scratched
          herself. For the first four days she might neither wash nor eat,
          but a little water was given her in a birch-bark cup painted red,
          and she sucked up the liquid through a tube made out of the leg of
          a crane, a swan, or a goose, for her lips might not touch the
          surface of the water. After the four days she was allowed, during
          the rest of the period of isolation, to eat, to wash, to lie down,
          to comb her hair, and to drink of streams and springs. But in
          drinking at these sources she had still to use her tube, otherwise
          the spring would dry up. While her seclusion lasted she performed
          by night various ceremonies, which were supposed to exert a
          beneficial influence on her future life. For example, she ran as
          fast as she could, praying at the same time to the Earth or Nature
          that she might be fleet of foot and tireless of limb. She dug
          trenches, in order that in after life she might be able to dig well
          and to work hard. These and other ceremonies she repeated for four
          nights or mornings in succession, four times each morning, and each
          time she supplicated the Dawn of the Day. Among the Lower Thompson
          Indians she carried a staff for one night; and when the day was
          breaking she leaned the staff against the stump of a tree and
          prayed to the Dawn that she might be blessed with a good husband,
          who was symbolized by the staff. She also wandered some nights to
          lonely parts of the mountains, where she would dance, imploring the
          spirits to pity and protect her during her future life; then, the
          dance and prayer over, she would lie down on the spot and fall
          asleep. Again, she carried four stones in her bosom to a spring,
          where she spat upon the stones and threw them one after the other
          into the water, praying that all disease might leave her, as these
          stones did. Also she ran four times in the early morning with two
          small stones in her bosom; and as she ran the stones slipped down
          between her bare body and her clothes and fell to the <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page051">[pg 051]</span><a name="Pg051" id="Pg051"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> ground. At the same time she prayed to
          the Dawn that when she should be with child, she might be delivered
          as easily as she was delivered of these stones. But whatever
          exercises she performed or prayers she offered on the lonely
          mountains during the hours of darkness or while the morning light
          was growing in the east, she must always be back in her little hut
          before the sun rose. There she often passed the tedious hours away
          picking the needles, one by one, from the cones on two large
          branches of fir, which hung from the roof of her hut on purpose to
          provide her with occupation. And as she picked she prayed to the
          fir-branch that she might never be lazy, but always quick and
          active at work. During her seclusion, too, she had to make
          miniatures of all the articles that Indian women make, or used to
          make, such as baskets, mats, ropes, and thread. This she did in
          order that afterwards she might be able to make the real things
          properly. Four large fir-branches also were placed in front of the
          hut, so that when she went out or in, she had to step over them.
          The branches were renewed every morning and the old ones thrown
          away into the water, while the girl prayed, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“May I never bewitch any man, nor my fellow-women! May
          it never happen!”</span> The first four times that she went out and
          in, she prayed to the fir-branches, saying, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“If ever I step into trouble or difficulties or step
          unknowingly inside the magical spell of some person, may you help
          me, O Fir-branches, with your power!”</span> Every day she painted
          her face afresh, and she wore strings of parts of deer-hoofs round
          her ankles and knees, and tied to her waistband on either side,
          which rattled when she walked or ran. Even the shape of the hut in
          which she lived was adapted to her future rather than to her
          present needs and wishes. If she wished to be tall, the hut was
          tall; if she wished to be short, it was low, sometimes so low that
          there was not room in it for her to stand erect, and she would lay
          the palm of her hand on the top of her head and pray to the Dawn
          that she might grow no taller. Her seclusion lasted four months.
          The Indians say that long ago it extended over a year, and that
          fourteen days elapsed before the girl was permitted to wash for the
          first time. The dress which she wore during her time of separation
          was <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page052">[pg 052]</span><a name=
          "Pg052" id="Pg052" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> afterwards taken to
          the top of a hill and burned, and the rest of her clothes were hung
          up on trees.<a id="noteref_124" name="noteref_124" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Among the
          Lillooet Indians of British Columbia, neighbours of the Thompsons,
          the customs observed by girls at puberty were similar. The damsels
          were secluded for a period of not less than one year nor more than
          four years, according to their own inclination and the wishes of
          their parents. Among the Upper Lillooets the hut in which the girl
          lodged was made of bushy fir-trees set up like a conical tent, the
          inner branches being lopped off, while the outer branches were
          closely interwoven and padded to form a roof. Every month or
          half-month the hut was shifted to another site or a new one
          erected. By day the girl sat in the hut; for the first month she
          squatted in a hole dug in the middle of it; and she passed the time
          making miniature baskets of birch-bark and other things, praying
          that she might be able to make the real things well in after years.
          At the dusk of the evening she left the hut and wandered about all
          night, but she returned before the sun rose. Before she quitted the
          hut at nightfall to roam abroad, she painted her face red and put
          on a mask of fir-branches, and in her hand, as she walked, she
          carried a basket-rattle to frighten ghosts and guard herself from
          evil. Among the Lower Lillooets, the girl's mask was often made of
          goat-skin, covering her head, neck, shoulders and breast, and
          leaving only a narrow opening from the brow to the chin. During the
          nocturnal hours she performed many ceremonies. Thus she put two
          smooth stones in her bosom and ran, and as they fell down between
          her body and her clothes, she prayed, saying, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“May I always have easy child-births!”</span> Now one
          of these stones represented her future child and the other
          represented the afterbirth. Also she dug trenches, praying that in
          the years to come she might be strong and tireless in digging
          roots; she picked leaves and needles from the fir-trees, praying
          that her fingers might be nimble in picking berries; and she tore
          sheets of birch-bark into <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page053">[pg
          053]</span><a name="Pg053" id="Pg053" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          shreds, dropping the shreds as she walked and asking that her hands
          might never tire and that she might make neat and fine work of
          birch-bark. Moreover, she ran and walked much that she might be
          light of foot. And every evening, when the shadows were falling,
          and every morning, when the day was breaking, she prayed to the
          Dusk of the Evening or to the Dawn of Day, saying, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“O Dawn of Day!”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“O
          Dusk,”</span> as it might be, <span class="tei tei-q">“may I be
          able to dig roots fast and easily, and may I always find
          plenty!”</span> All her prayers were addressed to the Dusk of the
          Evening or the Dawn of Day. She supplicated both, asking for long
          life, health, wealth, and happiness.<a id="noteref_125" name=

          bleeds. She is forbidden to touch her head, for which purpose she
          uses a comb with three points. Neither is she allowed to scratch
          her body, except with a painted deer-bone. She wears the bone and
          the comb suspended from her belt. She drinks out of a painted cup
          of birch-bark, and neither more nor less than the quantity it
          holds. Every night she walks about her hut, and plants willow
          twigs, which she has painted, and to the ends of which she has
          attached pieces of cloth, into the ground. It is believed that thus
          she will become rich in later life. In order to become strong she
          should climb trees and try to break off their points. She plays
          with <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

          During the day the girl stays in her hut and occupies herself in
          making miniature bags, mats, and baskets, in sewing and embroidery,
          in manufacturing thread, twine, and so forth; in short she makes a
          beginning of all kinds of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page054">[pg

          woman's work, in order that she may be a good housewife in after
          life. By night she roams the mountains and practises running,
          climbing, carrying burdens, and digging trenches, so that she may
          be expert at digging roots. If she has wandered far and daylight
          overtakes her, she hides herself behind a veil of fir branches; for
          no one, except her instructor or nearest relatives, should see her
          face during her period of seclusion. She wore a large robe painted

          Again, among the Cheyennes, an Indian tribe of the Missouri valley,
          a girl at her first menstruation is painted red all over her body
          and secluded in a special little lodge for four days. However, she
          may remain in her father's lodge provided that there are no charms
          (<span class="tei tei-q">“medicine”</span>), no sacred bundle, and
          no shield in it, or that these and all other objects invested with
          a sacred character have been removed. For four days she may not eat
          boiled meat; the flesh of which she partakes must be roasted over
          coals. Young men will not eat from the dish nor drink from the pot,
          which has been used by her; because <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          would be wounded in the next fight. She may not handle nor even

          she may not ride a horse, but is mounted on a mare.<a id=

          Alaska, a girl at puberty was placed in a small hut in which she
          had to remain on her hands and knees for six months; then the hut
          was enlarged a little so as to allow her to straighten her back,
          but in this posture she had to remain for six months more. All this
          time she was regarded as an unclean being with whom no one might
          hold intercourse. At the end of the year she was received back by

          Again, among the Malemut, and southward from the lower Yukon and
          adjacent districts, when a girl reaches the age of puberty she is
          considered unclean for forty days and must therefore live by
          herself in a corner of the house with her face to the wall, always
          keeping her hood over her head and her hair hanging dishevelled
          over her eyes. But if it is summer, she commonly lives in a rough
          shelter outside the house. She may not go out by day, and only once
          at night, when every one else is asleep. At the end of the period
          she bathes and is clothed in new garments, whereupon she may be

          enveloped in a peculiar atmosphere of such a sort that were a young
          man to come near enough for it to touch him, it would render him

          Southern Brazil, on the borders of Paraguay, used to sew her up in
          her hammock, leaving only a small opening in it to allow her to
          breathe. In this condition, wrapt up and shrouded like a corpse,
          she was kept for two or three days or so long as the symptoms
          lasted, and during this time she had to observe a most rigorous
          fast. After that she was entrusted to a matron, who cut the girl's
          hair and enjoined her to abstain most strictly from eating flesh of
          any kind until her hair should be grown long enough to hide her
          ears. Meanwhile the diviners drew omens of her future character
          from the various birds or animals that flew past or crossed her
          path. If they saw a parrot, they would say she was a chatterbox; if
          an owl, she was lazy and useless for domestic labours, and so

          similar circumstances the Chiriguanos of south-eastern Bolivia
          hoisted the girl in her hammock to the roof, where she stayed for a
          month: the second month the hammock was let half-way down from the
          roof; and in the third month old women, armed with sticks, entered
          the hut and ran about striking everything they met, saying they
          were hunting the snake that had wounded the girl.<a id=

          Lengua Indians of the Paraguayan Chaco under similar circumstances
          hang the girl in her hammock from the roof of the house, but they
          leave her there only three days and nights, during which they give
          her nothing to eat but a little Paraguay tea or boiled maize. Only
          her mother or grandmother has access to her; nobody else approaches
          or speaks to her. If she is obliged to leave the hammock for a
          little, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page057">[pg

          serpent that would swallow her up. She must also be very careful
          not to set foot on the droppings of fowls or animals, else she
          would suffer from sores on the throat and breast. On the third day
          they let her down from the hammock, cut her hair, and make her sit
          in a corner of the room with her face turned to the wall. She may
          speak to nobody, and must abstain from flesh and fish. These
          rigorous observances she must practise for nearly a year. Many
          girls die or are injured for life in consequence of the hardships

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Among the
          Yuracares, an Indian tribe of Bolivia, at the eastern foot of the
          Andes, when a girl perceives the signs of puberty, she informs her
          parents. The mother weeps and the father constructs a little hut of
          palm leaves near the house. In this cabin he shuts up his daughter
          so that she cannot see the light, and there she remains fasting
          rigorously for four days. Meantime the mother, assisted by the
          women of the neighbourhood, has brewed a large quantity of the
          native intoxicant called <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">chicha</span></span>, and poured it into
          wooden troughs and palm leaves. On the morning of the fourth day,
          three hours before the dawn, the girl's father, having arrayed
          himself in his savage finery, summons all his neighbours with loud
          cries. The damsel is seated on a stone, and every guest in turn
          cuts off a lock of her hair, and running away hides it in the
          hollow trunk of a tree in the depths of the forest. When they have
          all done so and seated themselves again gravely in the circle, the
          girl offers <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page058">[pg
          058]</span><a name="Pg058" id="Pg058" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          to each of them a calabash full of very strong <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">chicha</span></span>. Before the wassailing
          begins, the various fathers perform a curious operation on the arms
          of their sons, who are seated beside them. The operator takes a
          very sharp bone of an ape, rubs it with a pungent spice, and then
          pinching up the skin of his son's arm he pierces it with the bone
          through and through, as a surgeon might introduce a seton. This
          operation he repeats till the young man's arm is riddled with holes
          at regular intervals from the shoulder to the wrist. Almost all who
          take part in the festival are covered with these wounds, which the
          Indians call <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">culucute</span></span>. Having thus prepared
          themselves to spend a happy day, they drink, play on flutes, sing
          and dance till evening. Rain, thunder, and lightning, should they
          befall, have no effect in damping the general enjoyment or
          preventing its continuance till after the sun has set. The motive
          for perforating the arms of the young men is to make them skilful
          hunters; at each perforation the sufferer is cheered by the promise
          of another sort of game or fish which the surgical operation will
          infallibly procure for him. The same operation is performed on the
          arms and legs of the girls, in order that they may be brave and
          strong; even the dogs are operated on with the intention of making
          them run down the game better. For five or six months afterwards
          the damsel must cover her head with bark and refrain from speaking
          to men. The Yuracares think that if they did not submit a young
          girl to this severe ordeal, her children would afterwards perish by
          accidents of various kinds, such as the sting of a serpent, the
          bite of a jaguar, the fall of a tree, the wound of an arrow, or
          what not.<a id="noteref_135" name="noteref_135" href=

          had to undergo among the Indians on the south-east coast of that
          country, near what is now Rio de Janeiro. When a girl had reached
          this critical period of life, her hair was burned or shaved off
          close to the head. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page060">[pg
          060]</span><a name="Pg060" id="Pg060" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          Then she was placed on a flat stone and cut with the tooth of an
          animal from the shoulders all down the back, till she ran with
          blood. Next the ashes of a wild gourd were rubbed into the wounds;
          the girl was bound hand and foot, and hung in a hammock, being
          enveloped in it so closely that no one could see her. Here she had
          to stay for three days without eating or drinking. When the three
          days were over, she stepped out of the hammock upon the flat stone,
          for her feet might not touch the ground. If she had a call of
          nature, a female relation took the girl on her back and carried her
          out, taking with her a live coal to prevent evil influences from
          entering the girl's body. Being replaced in her hammock, she was
          now allowed to get some flour, boiled roots, and water, but might
          not taste salt or flesh. Thus she continued to the end of the first
          monthly period, at the expiry of which she was gashed on the breast
          and belly as well as all down the back. During the second month she
          still stayed in her hammock, but her rule of abstinence was less
          rigid, and she was allowed to spin. The third month she was
          blackened with a certain pigment and began to go about as
          usual.<a id="noteref_141" name="noteref_141" href=

          Sometimes, in addition to being stung with ants, the sufferer has
          to fast day and night so long as she remains slung up on high in
          her hammock, so that when she comes down she is reduced to a
          skeleton. The intention of stinging her with ants is said to be to
          make her strong to bear the burden of maternity.<a id="noteref_144"

          Amongst the Uaupes of Brazil a girl at puberty is secluded in the
          house for a month, and allowed only a small quantity of bread and
          water. Then she is taken out into the midst of her relations and
          friends, each of whom gives her four or five blows with pieces of
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">sipo</span></span> (an elastic climber), till
          she falls senseless or dead. If she recovers, the operation is
          repeated four times at intervals of six hours, and it is considered
          an offence to the parents not to strike hard. Meantime, pots of
          meats and fish have been made ready; the <span class=

          warriors and may not marry till they have passed through a terrible
          ordeal, which consists in being stung by swarms of venomous ants
          whose bite is like fire. Thus among the Mauhes on the Tapajos
          river, a southern tributary of the Amazon, boys of eight to ten
          years are obliged to thrust their arms into sleeves stuffed with
          great ferocious ants, which the Indians call <span class=

          the young victim shrieks with pain, an excited mob of men dances
          round him, shouting and encouraging him till he falls exhausted to
          the ground. He is then committed to the care of old women, who
          treat his fearfully swollen arms with fresh juice of the manioc;
          and on his recovery he has to shew his strength and skill in
          bending a bow. This cruel ordeal is commonly repeated again and
          again, till the lad has reached his fourteenth year and can bear
          the agony without betraying any sign of emotion. Then he is a man
          and can marry. A lad's age is reckoned by the number of times he
          has passed through the ordeal.<a id="noteref_147" name=

          with an endurance more than Spartan, dancing and singing, with his
          arms cased in the terrible mittens, before every cabin of the great
          common house, till pallid, staggering, and with chattering teeth he
          triumphantly laid the gloves before the old chief and received the
          congratulations of the men and the caresses of the women; then
          breaking away from his friends and admirers he threw himself into
          the river and remained in its cool soothing water till

          sort of basket full of venomous ants and keep it there for several
          minutes without uttering a cry. He generally falls backwards and
          sometimes succumbs to the fever which ensues; hence as soon as the
          ordeal is over the women are prodigal of their attentions to him,

          borders of Guiana, young men who are candidates for marriage must
          submit to be stung all over their persons not only with ants but
          with wasps, which are applied to their naked bodies in curious
          instruments of trellis-work shaped like fantastic quadrupeds or
          birds. The patient invariably falls down in a swoon and is carried
          like dead to his hammock, where he is tightly lashed with cords. As
          they come to themselves, they writhe in agony, so that their
          hammocks rock violently to and fro, causing the hut to shake as if

          Similarly the Indians of St. Juan Capistrano in California used to
          be branded on some part of their bodies, generally on the right
          arm, but sometimes on the leg also, not as a proof of manly
          fortitude, but because they believed that the custom <span class=

          better pulse for the management of the bow.”</span> Afterwards
          <span class="tei tei-q">“they were whipped with nettles, and
          covered with ants, that they might become robust, and the

          July and August, when the nettle was in its most fiery state. They
          gathered small bunches, which they fastened together, and the poor
          deluded Indian was chastised, by inflicting blows with them upon
          his naked limbs, until unable to walk; and then he was carried to
          the nest of the nearest and most furious species of ants, and laid
          down among them, while some of his friends, with sticks, kept
          annoying the insects to make them still more violent. What torments
          did they not undergo! What pain! What hellish inflictions! Yet
          their faith gave them power to endure all without a murmur, and
          they remained as if dead. Having undergone these dreadful ordeals,

          pain inflicted on the person beaten was no more the object of the

          interpreted otherwise, and the pain, from being an accident, became
          the prime object of the ceremony, which was now regarded either as
          a test of endurance imposed upon persons at critical epochs of
          life, or as a mortification of the flesh well pleasing to the god.

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If this view is
          correct, we can understand why so many Indian tribes of South
          America compel the youth of both sexes to submit to these painful
          and sometimes fatal ordeals. They imagine that in this way they rid
          the young folk of certain evils inherent in youth, especially at
          the critical age of puberty; and when they picture to themselves
          the evils in a personal form as dangerous spirits or demons, the
          ceremony of their expulsion may in the strict sense be termed an
          exorcism. This certainly appears to be the interpretation which the
          Banivas of the Orinoco put upon the cruel scourgings which they
          inflict on girls at puberty. At her first menstruation a Baniva
          girl must pass several days and nights in her hammock, almost
          motionless and getting nothing to eat and drink but water and a
          little manioc. While she lies there, the suitors for her hand apply
          to her father, and he who can afford to give most for her or can
          prove himself the best man, is promised the damsel in marriage. The
          fast over, some old men enter the hut, bandage the girl's eyes,
          cover her head with a bonnet of which the fringes fall on her
          shoulders, and then lead her forth and tie her to a post set up in
          an open place. The head of the post is carved in the shape of a
          grotesque face. None but the old men may witness what follows. Were
          a woman caught peeping and prying, it would go ill with her; she
          would be marked out for the vengeance of the demon, who would make
          her expiate her crime at the very next moon by madness or death.
          Every participant in the ceremony comes armed with a scourge of
          cords or of fish skins; some of them reinforce the virtue of the
          instrument by tying little sharp stones to the end of the thongs.
          Then, to the dismal and deafening notes of shell-trumpets blown by
          two or three supernumeraries, the men circle round and round the
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page067">[pg 067]</span><a name=
          "Pg067" id="Pg067" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> post, every one
          applying his scourge as he passes to the girl's back, till it
          streams with blood. At last the musicians, winding tremendous
          blasts on their trumpets against the demon, advance and touch the
          post in which he is supposed to be incorporate. Then the blows
          cease to descend; the girl is untied, often in a fainting state,
          and carried away to have her wounds washed and simples applied to
          them. The youngest of the executioners, or rather of the exorcists,
          hastens to inform her betrothed husband of the happy issue of the
          exorcism. <span class="tei tei-q">“The spirit,”</span> he says,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“had cast thy beloved into a sleep as deep
          almost as that of death. But we have rescued her from his attacks,
          and laid her down in such and such a place. Go seek her.”</span>
          Then going from house to house through the village he cries to the
          inmates, <span class="tei tei-q">“Come, let us burn the demon who
          would have taken possession of such and such a girl, our
          friend.”</span> The bridegroom at once carries his wounded and
          suffering bride to his own house; and all the people gather round
          the post for the pleasure of burning it and the demon together. A
          great pile of firewood has meanwhile been heaped up about it, and
          the women run round the pyre cursing in shrill voices the wicked
          spirit who has wrought all this evil. The men join in with hoarser
          cries and animate themselves for the business in hand by deep
          draughts of an intoxicant which has been provided for the occasion
          by the parents-in-law. Soon the bridegroom, having committed the
          bride to the care of his mother, appears on the scene brandishing a
          lighted torch. He addresses the demon with bitter mockery and
          reproaches; informs him that the fair creature on whom he, the
          demon, had nefarious designs, is now his, the bridegroom's,
          blooming spouse; and shaking his torch at the grinning head on the
          post, he screams out, <span class="tei tei-q">“This is how the
          victims of thy persecution take vengeance on thee!”</span> With
          these words he puts a light to the pyre. At once the drums strike
          up, the trumpets blare, and men, women, and children begin to
          dance. In two long rows they dance, the men on one side, the women
          on the other, advancing till they almost touch and then retiring
          again. After that the two rows join hands, and forming a huge
          circle trip it round and round the blaze, till the post with its
          grotesque face is consumed in the flames <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page068">[pg 068]</span><a name="Pg068" id="Pg068" class=

          she goes to a neighbouring tank, accompanied by five women whose

          the sky, and woe betide her if she catches sight of a crow or a
          cat! Her diet must be strictly vegetarian, without salt, tamarinds,
          or chillies. She is armed against evil spirits by a knife, which is

          monthly period remains under pollution for thirteen days, either in
          a corner of the house, which is screened off for her use by her
          maternal uncle, or in a temporary hut, which is erected by the same
          relative on the common land of the village. On the thirteenth day
          she bathes in a tank, and, on entering the house, steps over a
          pestle and a cake. Near the entrance some food is placed and a dog
          is allowed to partake of it; but his enjoyment is marred by
          suffering, for while he eats he receives a sound thrashing, and the
          louder he howls the better, for the larger will be the family to
          which the young woman will give birth; should there be no howls,
          there will be no children. The temporary hut in which the girl
          passed the days of her seclusion is burnt down, and the pots which
          she used are smashed to shivers.<a id="noteref_160" name=

          Similarly among the Parivarams of Madura, when a girl attains to
          puberty she is kept for sixteen days in a hut, which is guarded at
          night by her relations; and when her sequestration is over the hut
          is burnt down and the pots she used are broken into very small
          pieces, because they think that if rain-water gathered in any of
          them, the girl would be childless.<a id="noteref_161" name=

          use of a girl at puberty; there she remains for seven days. No one
          else may enter the hut, not even her mother. Women stand a little
          way off and lay down food for her. At the end of the time she is
          brought home, clad in a new or clean cloth, and friends are treated
          to betel-nut, toddy, and arack.<a id="noteref_162" name=

          the Singhalese a girl at her first menstruation is confined to a
          room, where she may neither see nor be seen by any male. After
          being thus secluded for two weeks she is taken out, with her face
          covered, and is bathed by women at the back <span class=

          According to another account, a Cambodian maiden at puberty is said

          her retirement, which, according to the rank and position of her
          family, may last any time from a few days to several years, she has
          to observe a number of rules, such as not to be seen by a strange
          man, not to eat flesh or fish, and so on. She goes nowhere, not
          even to the pagoda. But this state of seclusion is discontinued
          during eclipses; at such times she goes forth and pays her
          devotions to the monster who is supposed to cause eclipses by
          catching the heavenly bodies between his teeth.<a id="noteref_165"

          read of a princess who was fated to be carried off by a warlock if
          ever the sun shone on her before she had passed her thirtieth year;
          so the king her father kept her shut up in the palace, and had all
          the windows on the east, south, and west sides blocked up, lest a
          sunbeam should fall on his darling child, and he <span class=

          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> should thus lose her for ever. Only at
          evening, when the sun was down, might she walk for a little in the
          beautiful garden of the castle. In time a prince came a-wooing,
          followed by a train of gorgeous knights and squires on horses all
          ablaze with gold and silver. The king said the prince might have
          his daughter to wife on condition that he would not carry her away
          to his home till she was thirty years old but would live with her
          in the castle, where the windows looked out only to the north. The
          prince agreed, so married they were. The bride was only fifteen,
          and fifteen more long weary years must pass before she might step
          out of the gloomy donjon, breathe the fresh air, and see the sun.
          But she and her gallant young bridegroom loved each other and they
          were happy. Often they sat hand in hand at the window looking out
          to the north and talked of what they would do when they were free.
          Still it was a little dull to look out always at the same window
          and to see nothing but the castle woods, and the distant hills, and
          the clouds drifting silently over them. Well, one day it happened
          that all the people in the castle had gone away to a neighbouring
          castle to witness a tournament and other gaieties, and the two
          young folks were left as usual all alone at the window looking out
          to the north. They sat silent for a time gazing away to the hills.
          It was a grey sad day, the sky was overcast, and the weather seemed
          to draw to rain. At last the prince said, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“There will be no sunshine to-day. What if we were to
          drive over and join the rest at the tournament?”</span> His young
          wife gladly consented, for she longed to see more of the world than
          those eternal green woods and those eternal blue hills, which were
          all she ever saw from the window. So the horses were put into the
          coach, and it rattled up to the door, and in they got and away they
          drove. At first all went well. The clouds hung low over the woods,
          the wind sighed in the trees, a drearier day you could hardly
          imagine. So they joined the rest at the other castle and took their
          seats to watch the jousting in the lists. So intent were they in
          watching the gay spectacle of the prancing steeds, the fluttering
          pennons, and the glittering armour of the knights, that they failed
          to mark the change, the fatal change, in the <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page072">[pg 072]</span><a name="Pg072" id="Pg072"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> weather. For the wind was rising and
          had begun to disperse the clouds, and suddenly the sun broke
          through, and the glory of it fell like an aureole on the young
          wife, and at once she vanished away. No sooner did her husband miss
          her from his side than he, too, mysteriously disappeared. The
          tournament broke up in confusion, the bereft father hastened home,
          and shut himself up in the dark castle from which the light of life
          had departed. The green woods and the blue hills could still be
          seen from the window that looked to the north, but the young faces
          that had gazed out of it so wistfully were gone, as it seemed, for
          ever.<a id="noteref_166" name="noteref_166" href=

          the palace in a carefully closed coach, himself sitting on the box
          and handling the reins. On the way they overtook two hideous
          witches, who pretended they were weary and begged for a lift in the
          coach. At first the brother refused to take them in, but his
          tender-hearted sister entreated him to have compassion on the two
          poor footsore women; for you may easily imagine that she was not
          acquainted with their true character. So down he got rather surlily
          from the box, opened the coach door, and in the two witches
          stepped, laughing in their sleeves. But no sooner had the brother
          mounted the box and whipped up the horses, than one of the two
          wicked witches bored a hole in the closed coach. A sunbeam at once
          shot through the hole and fell on the fair damsel. So she vanished
          from the coach and was spirited away into the belly of a whale in
          the neighbouring sea. You can imagine the consternation of the

          perhaps belongs to the same class of tales. It has its counterpart
          in the legend which the Kirghiz of Siberia tell of their ancestry.
          A certain Khan had a fair daughter, whom he kept in a dark iron
          house, that no man might see her. An old woman tended her; and when
          the girl was grown to maidenhood she asked the old woman,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Where do you go so often?”</span>
          <span class="tei tei-q">“My child,”</span> said the old dame,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“there is a bright world. In that bright
          world your father and mother live, and all sorts of people live
          there. That is where I go.”</span> The maiden said, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Good mother, I will tell nobody, but shew me that
          bright world.”</span> So the old woman took the girl out of the
          iron house. But when she saw the bright world, the girl tottered
          and fainted; and the eye of God fell upon her, and she conceived.
          Her angry father put her in a golden chest and sent her floating
          away (fairy gold can float in fairyland) over the wide sea.<a id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The idea that
          women may be impregnated by the sun is not uncommon in legends.
          Thus, for example, among the Indians of Guacheta in Colombia, it is
          said, a report once ran that the sun would impregnate one of their
          maidens, who should bear a child and yet remain a virgin. The chief
          had two daughters, and was very desirous that one of them should
          conceive in this miraculous manner. So every day he made them climb
          a hill to the east of his house in order to be touched by the first
          beams of the rising sun. His wishes were fulfilled, for one of the
          damsels conceived and after nine months gave birth to an emerald.
          So she wrapped it in cotton and placed it in her bosom, and in a
          few days it turned into a child, who received the name of
          Garanchacha and was universally recognized as a son of the
          sun.<a id="noteref_173" name="noteref_173" href=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">173</span></span></a>
          Again, the Samoans tell of a woman named Mangamangai, <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page075">[pg 075]</span><a name="Pg075" id="Pg075"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> who became pregnant by looking at the
          rising sun. Her son grew up and was named <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Child of the Sun.”</span> At his marriage he applied
          to his mother for a dowry, but she bade him apply to his father,
          the sun, and told him how to go to him. So one morning he took a
          long vine and made a noose in it; then climbing up a tree he threw
          the noose over the sun and caught him fast. Thus arrested in his
          progress, the luminary asked him what he wanted, and being told by
          the young man that he wanted a present for his bride, the sun
          obligingly packed up a store of blessings in a basket, with which
          the youth descended to the earth.<a id="noteref_174" name=

          Amongst the Turks of Siberia it was formerly the custom on the
          morning after the marriage to lead the young couple out of the hut
          to greet the rising sun. The same custom is said to be still
          practised in Iran and Central Asia under a belief that the beams of
          the rising sun are the surest means of impregnating the new
          bride.<a id="noteref_177" name="noteref_177" href=

          as some people think that women may be gotten with child by the

          and caress them; for which reason no woman dare sleep lying upon
          her back, without she first spits upon her fingers and rubs her
          belly with it. For the same reason the young maids are afraid to

          first appearance; hence the restrictions under which women lie at
          their first menstruation are usually more stringent than those
          which they have to observe at any subsequent recurrence of the
          mysterious flow. Some evidence of the fear and of the customs based

          as the terror, for it is nothing less, which the phenomenon

          camps in the Wakelbura tribe which forbids the women coming into
          the encampment by the same path as the men. Any violation of this
          rule would in a large camp be punished with death. The reason for
          this is the dread with which they regard the menstrual period of
          women. During such a time, a woman is kept entirely away from the
          camp, half a mile at least. A woman in such a condition has boughs
          of some tree of her totem tied round her loins, and is constantly
          watched and guarded, for it is thought that should any male be so
          unfortunate as to see a woman in such a condition, he would die. If
          such a woman were to let herself be seen by a man, she would
          probably be put to death. When the woman has recovered, she is

          who did not menstruate was believed by the Baganda to be a source
          of danger to her husband, indeed capable of killing him. Hence,
          before he went to war, he used to wound her slightly with his spear

          Apparently the notion was that if the wife did not lose blood in
          one way or another, her husband would be bled in war to make up for
          her deficiency; so by way of guarding against this undesirable
          event, he took care to relieve her of a little superfluous blood
          before he repaired to the field of honour. Further, the Baganda
          would not suffer a menstruous woman to visit a well; if she did so,
          they feared that the water would dry up, and that she herself would
          fall sick and die, unless she confessed her fault and the

          the Ewe negroes of this region each village has its huts where

          themselves in public places; sometimes they are mere shelters built
          either at the back or front of the ordinary dwelling-houses. A
          woman is punishable if she does not pass the time of her monthly
          sickness in one of these huts or shelters provided for her use.
          Thus, if she shews herself in her own house or even in the yard of
          the house, she may be fined a sheep, which is killed, its flesh
          divided among the people, and its blood poured on the image of the

          is distributed, and its blood, diluted with water and mixed with

          her after the manner of women she went forth from the city and
          dwelt for a time in the suburb, for such was the custom of the
          place. Now it fell out that, while she tarried there, Sapor saw her
          and loved her, and she loved him; for he was a handsome man and she
          a lovely maid. And she said to him, <span class="tei tei-q">“What
          will you give me if I shew you how you may destroy the walls of
          this city and slay my father?”</span> And he said to her,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“I will give you what you will, and I will
          exalt you above my other wives, and will set you nearer to me than

          walls of the city, and they will fall down.”</span> For that, says
          the Arab historian, was the talisman of the city, which could not
          be destroyed in any other way. And Sapor did as she bade him, and
          the city fell down in a heap, and he stormed it and slew Daizan on

          is to be preserved by salting, whether it be fish, flesh, or
          vegetables; for were she to touch it the food would putrefy. She
          may not enter any sacred place, she may not be present at any
          religious ceremony. The linen which she wears at such times must be
          washed by herself at sunrise, never at night. On reaching puberty
          girls may not touch flowers or the fruits of certain trees, for
          touched by them the flowers would fade and the fruits fall to the
          ground. <span class="tei tei-q">“It is on account of their

          food; all is prepared and carried to her. When the sickness is

            </div>
          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Among most
          tribes of North American Indians the custom was that women in their
          courses retired from the camp or the village and lived during the
          time of their uncleanness in special huts or shelters which were
          appropriated to their use. There they dwelt apart, eating and
          sleeping by themselves, warming themselves at their own fires, and
          strictly abstaining from all communications with men, who shunned
          them just as if they were stricken with the plague. No article of
          furniture used in these menstrual huts might be used in any other,
          not even the flint and steel with which in the old days the fires
          were kindled. No one would borrow a light from a woman in her
          seclusion. If a white man in his ignorance asked to light his pipe
          at her fire, she would refuse to grant the request, telling him
          that it would make his nose bleed and his head ache, and that he
          would fall sick in consequence. If an Indian's wooden pipe cracked,
          his friends would think that he had either lit it at one of these
          polluted fires or had held some converse with a woman during her
          retirement, which was esteemed a most disgraceful and wicked thing
          to do. Decent men would not approach within a certain distance of a
          woman at such times, and if they had to convey anything to her they
          would stand some forty or fifty paces off and throw it to her.
          Everything which was touched by her hands during this period was
          deemed ceremonially unclean. Indeed her touch was thought to convey
          such pollution that if she chanced to lay a finger on a chief's
          lodge or his gun or anything else belonging to him, it would be
          instantly destroyed. If she crossed the path of a hunter or a
          warrior, his luck for that day at least would be gone. Were she not
          thus secluded, it was supposed that the men would be attacked by
          diseases of various kinds, which would prove mortal. In some tribes
          a woman who infringed the rules of separation might have to answer
          with her life for any misfortunes that might happen to individuals
          or to the tribe in consequence, as it was supposed, of her criminal
          negligence. When she quitted her tent or hut to go into retirement,
          the fire in it was extinguished and the ashes thrown away outside
          of the village, and a new fire was kindled, as if the old one had
          been defiled by her presence. At the end of their <span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus, to take
          examples, the Creek and kindred Indians of the United States
          compelled women at menstruation to live in separate huts at some
          distance from the village. There the women had to stay, at the risk
          of being surprised and cut off by enemies. It was thought
          <span class="tei tei-q">“a most horrid and dangerous
          pollution”</span> to go near the women at such times; and the
          danger extended to enemies who, if they slew the women, had to
          cleanse themselves from the pollution by means of certain sacred
          herbs and roots.<a id="noteref_225" name="noteref_225" href=

          Similarly, the Choctaw women had to quit their huts during their
          monthly periods, and might not return till after they had been
          purified. While their uncleanness lasted they had to prepare their
          own food. The men believed that if they were to approach a
          menstruous woman, they would fall ill, and that some mishap would
          overtake them when they went to the wars.<a id="noteref_226" name=

          lasts four days. During this time she may not approach or touch a

          touch any article of furniture or food which the men have occasion

          placed outside of the camp; if on a march, they are not allowed to
          follow the trail, but must take a different path and keep at a

          believed that if they slept with their wives at such times, they
          would probably be wounded in their next battle. A man who owned a
          shield had very particularly to be on his guard against women in
          their courses. He might not go into a lodge where one of them
          happened to be, nor even into a lodge where one of them had been,
          until a ceremony of purification had been performed. Sweet grass
          and juniper were burnt in the tent, and the pegs were pulled up and
          the covering thrown back, as if the tent were about to be struck.
          After this pretence of decamping from the polluted spot the owner
          of the shield might enter the tent.<a id="noteref_229" name=

          husband nor her father would dream of going out to hunt while she

          the rest of the people during every recurring period of
          menstruation, and had to live some little way off in a small brush
          or bark lodge made for the purpose. At these times she was
          considered unclean, must use cooking and eating utensils of her
          own, and was supplied with food by some other woman. If she smoked
          out of a pipe other than her own, that pipe would ever afterwards
          be hot to smoke. If she crossed in front of a gun, that gun would
          thenceforth be useless for the war or the chase, unless indeed the
          owner promptly washed the weapon in <span class=

          each principal part of her body. If a man ate or had any
          intercourse with a menstruous woman, nay if he merely wore clothes
          or mocassins made or patched by her, he would have bad luck in
          hunting and the bears would attack him fiercely. Before being
          admitted again among the people, she had to change all her clothes
          and wash several times in clear water. The clothes worn during her
          isolation were hung on a tree, to be used next time, or to be
          washed. For one day after coming back among the people she did not
          cook food. Were a man to eat food cooked by a woman at such times,

          soon as a girl has experienced the first flow of the menses which
          in the female constitution are a natural discharge, her father
          believed himself under the obligation of atoning for her supposedly
          sinful condition by a small impromptu distribution of clothes among
          the natives. This periodical state of women was considered as one
          of legal impurity <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page092">[pg

          fateful both to the man who happened to have any intercourse,
          however indirect, with her, and to the woman herself who failed in
          scrupulously observing all the rites prescribed by ancient usage
          for persons in her condition.</span></p>

          was immediately sequestered from company, even that of her parents,
          and compelled to dwell in a small branch hut by herself away from
          beaten paths and the gaze of passers-by. As she was supposed to
          exercise malefic influence on any man who might inadvertently
          glance at her, she had to wear a sort of head-dress combining in
          itself the purposes of a veil, a bonnet, and a mantlet. It was made
          of tanned skin, its forepart was shaped like a long fringe
          completely hiding from view the face and breasts; then it formed on
          the head a close-fitting cap or bonnet, and finally fell in a broad
          band almost to the heels. This head-dress was made and publicly
          placed on her head by a paternal aunt, who received at once some
          present from the girl's father. When, three or four years later,
          the period of sequestration ceased, only this same aunt had the
          right to take off her niece's ceremonial head-dress. Furthermore,
          the girl's fingers, wrists, and legs at the ankles and immediately
          below the knees, were encircled with ornamental rings and bracelets
          of sinew intended as a protection against the malign influences she
          was supposed to be possessed with.<a id="noteref_236" name=

          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

          former was a hollowed swan bone to drink with, any other mode of
          drinking being unlawful to her. The latter was fork-like and was
          called into requisition whenever she wanted to scratch her
          head—immediate contact of the fingers with the head being reputed
          injurious to her health. While thus secluded, she was called

          and abstinence. Her only allowed food consisted of dried fish
          boiled in a small bark vessel which nobody else must touch, and she
          had to abstain especially from meat of any kind, as well as fresh
          fish. Nor was this all she had to endure; even her contact, however
          remote, with these two articles of diet was so dreaded that she
          could not cross the public paths or trails, or the tracks of
          animals. Whenever absolute necessity constrained her to go beyond
          such spots, she had to be packed or carried over them lest she
          should contaminate the game or meat which had passed that way, or
          had been brought over these paths; and also for the sake of
          self-preservation against tabooed, and consequently to her,
          deleterious food. In the same way she was never allowed to wade in
          streams or lakes, for fear of causing death to the fish.</span></p>

          fast and resulting weakness; but chiefly as an exhibition of a

          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the devices to which these Indians used
          to resort for the sake of ensuring success in the chase
          <span class="tei tei-q">“were based on their regard for continence

          the strict observances imposed on Tinneh or Déné women at such
          times were designed at the same time to protect the women
          themselves from the evil consequences of their dangerous condition.
          Thus it was thought that women in their courses could not partake
          of the head, heart, or hind part of an animal that had been caught
          in a snare without exposing themselves to a premature death through
          a kind of rabies. They might not cut or carve salmon, because to do
          so would seriously endanger their health, and especially would
          enfeeble their arms for life. And they had to abstain from cutting
          up the grebes which are caught by the Carriers in great numbers
          every spring, because otherwise the blood with which these fowls
          abound would occasion hæmorrhage or an unnaturally prolonged flux
          in the transgressor.<a id="noteref_239" name="noteref_239" href=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">239</span></span></a>
          Similarly Indian women of the Thompson tribe abstained from venison
          and the flesh of other large game during menstruation, lest the
          animals should be displeased and the menstrual flow
          increased.<a id="noteref_240" name="noteref_240" href=

          same principle may perhaps partly explain the rule, of which we
          have had some examples, that women at such times should refrain
          from fish and flesh, and restrict themselves to a vegetable
          diet.</p>

          advanced stage of society in those elaborate codes which have been
          drawn up for the guidance of certain peoples by lawgivers who claim
          to have derived the rules they inculcate from the direct

          resemblance which exists between the earliest official utterances

          remarkable; whether it be, as some suppose, that God communed face
          to face with man in those early days, or, as others maintain, that
          man mistook his wild and wandering thoughts for a revelation from
          heaven. Be that as it may, certain it is that the natural
          uncleanness of woman at her monthly periods is a conception which
          has occurred, or been revealed, with singular unanimity to several
          ancient legislators. The Hindoo lawgiver Manu, who professed to
          have received his institutes from the creator Brahman, informs us
          that the wisdom, the energy, the strength, the sight, and the
          vitality of a man who approaches a woman in her courses will
          utterly perish; whereas, if he avoids her, his wisdom, energy,

          menstrous flow, at least in its abnormal manifestations, is a work
          of Ahriman, or the devil. Therefore, so long as it lasts, a woman
          <span class="tei tei-q">“is unclean and possessed of the demon; she
          must be kept confined, apart from the faithful whom her touch would

          not allowed to eat as much as she wishes, as the strength she might
          acquire would accrue to the fiends. Her food is not given her from

          menstruous woman turned wine to vinegar, blighted crops, killed
          seedlings, blasted gardens, brought down the fruit from trees,
          dimmed mirrors, blunted razors, rusted iron and brass (especially

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus the object
          of secluding women at menstruation is to neutralize the dangerous
          influences which are supposed to emanate from them at such times.
          That the danger is believed to be especially great at the first
          menstruation appears from the unusual precautions taken to isolate
          girls at this crisis. Two of these precautions have been
          illustrated above, namely, the rules that the girl may not touch
          the ground nor see the sun. The general effect of these rules is to
          keep her suspended, so to say, between heaven and earth. Whether
          enveloped in her hammock and slung up to the roof, as in South
          America, or raised above the ground in a dark and narrow cage, as
          in New Ireland, she may be considered to be out of the way of doing
          mischief, since, being shut off both from the earth and from the
          sun, she can poison neither of these great sources of life by her
          deadly contagion. In short, she is rendered harmless by being, in
          electrical language, insulated. But the precautions thus taken to
          isolate or insulate the girl are dictated by a regard for her own
          safety as well as for the safety of others. For it is thought that
          she herself would suffer if she were to neglect the prescribed
          regimen. Thus Zulu girls, as we have seen, believe that they would
          shrivel to skeletons if the sun were to shine on them at puberty,
          and in some Brazilian tribes the young women think that a
          transgression of the rules would entail sores on the neck and
          throat. In short, the girl is viewed as charged with a powerful
          force which, if not kept within bounds, may prove destructive both
          to herself and to all with whom she comes in contact. To repress
          this force within the limits necessary for the safety of all
          concerned is the object of the taboos in question.</p>

          differ materially from each other. They are only different
          manifestations of the same mysterious energy which, like energy in
          general, is in itself neither good <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          Accordingly, if, like girls at puberty, divine personages may
          neither touch the ground nor see the sun, the reason is, on the one
          hand, a fear lest their divinity might, at contact with earth or

          So when she came to her latter end, she did not really die but only
          looked like dead, and very soon they found her in a hollow of a
          pillar in the church, half standing and half sitting, motionless.
          She stirred never a limb, but they saw quite plainly that she was
          alive, and she sits there down to this blessed day. Every New

          shrink and shrivel up, till at last she could neither walk nor
          stand nor eat nor drink. But die she could not. At first they fed
          her as if she were a little child, but when she grew smaller and
          smaller they put her in a glass bottle and hung her up in the
          church. And there she still hangs, in the church of St. Mary, at

        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A deity whose life
        might in a sense be said to be neither in heaven nor on earth but
        between the two, was the Norse Balder, the good and beautiful god,
        the son of the great god Odin, and himself the wisest, mildest, best
        beloved of all the immortals. The story of his death, as it is told
        in the younger or prose <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Edda</span></span>, runs thus. Once on a time
        Balder dreamed heavy dreams which seemed to forebode his death.
        Thereupon the gods held a council and resolved to make him secure
        against every danger. So the goddess Frigg took an oath from fire and
        water, iron and all metals, stones and earth, from trees, sicknesses
        and poisons, and from all four-footed beasts, birds, and creeping
        things, that they would not hurt Balder. When this was done Balder
        was deemed invulnerable; so the gods amused themselves by setting him
        in their midst, while some shot at him, others hewed at him, and
        others threw stones at him. But whatever they did, nothing could hurt
        him; and at this they were all glad, Only Loki, the mischief-maker,
        was displeased, and he went in the guise of an old woman to Frigg,
        who told him that the weapons of the gods could not wound Balder,
        since she had made them all swear not to hurt him. Then Loki asked,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Have all things sworn to spare
        Balder?”</span> She answered, <span class="tei tei-q">“East of
        Walhalla grows a plant called mistletoe; it seemed to me too young to
        swear.”</span> So Loki went and pulled the mistletoe and took it to
        the assembly of the gods. There he found the blind god Hother
        standing at the outside of the circle. Loki asked him, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Why do you not shoot at Balder?”</span> Hother answered,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Because I do not see where <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page102">[pg 102]</span><a name="Pg102" id="Pg102"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> he stands; besides I have no
        weapon.”</span> Then said Loki, <span class="tei tei-q">“Do like the
        rest and shew Balder honour, as they all do. I will shew you where he
        stands, and do you shoot at him with this twig.”</span> Hother took
        the mistletoe and threw it at Balder, as Loki directed him. The
        mistletoe struck Balder and pierced him through and through, and he
        fell down dead. And that was the greatest misfortune that ever befell
        gods and men. For a while the gods stood speechless, then they lifted
        up their voices and wept bitterly. They took Balder's body and
        brought it to the sea-shore. There stood Balder's ship; it was called
        Ringhorn, and was the hugest of all ships. The gods wished to launch
        the ship and to burn Balder's body on it, but the ship would not
        stir. So they sent for a giantess called Hyrrockin. She came riding
        on a wolf and gave the ship such a push that fire flashed from the
        rollers and all the earth shook. Then Balder's body was taken and
        placed on the funeral pile upon his ship. When his wife Nanna saw
        that, her heart burst for sorrow and she died. So she was laid on the
        funeral pile with her husband, and fire was put to it. Balder's
        horse, too, with all its trappings, was burned on the pile.<a id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Writing about the
        end of the twelfth century, the old Danish historian Saxo Grammaticus
        tells the story of Balder in a form which professes to be historical.
        According to him, Balder and Hother were rival suitors for the hand
        of Nanna, daughter of Gewar, King of Norway. Now Balder was a demigod
        and common steel could not wound his sacred body. The two rivals
        encountered each other in a terrific battle, and though Odin and Thor
        and the rest of the gods fought for Balder, yet was he defeated and
        fled away, and Hother married the princess. Nevertheless Balder took
        heart of grace and again met Hother in a stricken field. But he fared
        even worse than before; for Hother dealt him a deadly wound with a
        magic sword, which he had received from Miming, the Satyr of the
        woods; and after lingering three days in pain Balder died of his hurt
        and was buried with royal honours in a barrow.<a id="noteref_259"

        On one of the bays of the beautiful Sogne Fiord, which penetrates far
        into the depths of the solemn Norwegian mountains, with their sombre
        pine-forests and their lofty cascades dissolving into spray before
        they reach the dark water of the fiord far below, Balder had a great
        sanctuary. It was called Balder's Grove. A palisade enclosed the
        hallowed ground, and within it stood a spacious temple with the
        images of many gods, but none of them was worshipped with such
        devotion as Balder. So great was the awe with which the heathen
        regarded the place that no man might harm another there, nor steal
        his cattle, nor defile himself with women. But women cared for the
        images of the gods in the temple; they warmed them at the fire,
        anointed them with oil, and dried them with cloths.<a id=

        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It might be rash
        to affirm that the romantic figure of Balder was nothing but a
        creation of the mythical fancy, a radiant phantom conjured up as by a
        wizard's wand to glitter for a time against the gloomy background of
        the stern Norwegian landscape. It may be so; yet it is also possible
        that the myth was founded on the tradition of a hero, popular and
        beloved in his lifetime, who long survived in the memory of the
        people, gathering more and more of the marvellous about him as he
        passed from generation to generation of story-tellers. At all events
        it is worth while to observe that a somewhat similar story is told of
        another national hero, who may well have been a real man. In his
        great poem, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">The Epic of Kings</span></span>, which is
        founded on Persian traditions, the poet Firdusi tells us that in the
        combat between Rustem and Isfendiyar the arrows of the former did no
        harm to his adversary, <span class="tei tei-q">“because Zerdusht had
        charmed his body against all dangers, so that it was like unto
        brass.”</span> But Simurgh, the bird of God, shewed Rustem the way he
        should follow in order to vanquish his redoubtable foe. He rode after
        her, and they halted not till they came to the sea-shore. There she
        led him into a garden, where grew a <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page105">[pg 105]</span><a name="Pg105" id="Pg105" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> tamarisk, tall and strong, and the roots
        thereof were in the ground, but the branches pierced even unto the
        sky. Then the bird of God bade Rustem break from the tree a branch
        that was long and slender, and fashion it into an arrow, and she
        said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Only through his eyes can Isfendiyar
        be wounded. If, therefore, thou wouldst slay him, direct this arrow
        unto his forehead, and verily it shall not miss its aim.”</span>
        Rustem did as he was bid; and when next he fought with Isfendiyar, he
        shot the arrow at him, and it pierced his eye, and he died. Great was

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Whatever may be
        thought of an historical kernel underlying a mythical husk in the
        legend of Balder, the details of the story suggest that it belongs to
        that class of myths which have been dramatized in ritual, or, to put
        it otherwise, which have been performed as magical ceremonies for the
        sake of producing those natural effects which they describe in
        figurative language. A myth is never so graphic and precise in its
        details as when it is, so to speak, the book of the words which are
        spoken and acted by the performers of the sacred rite. That the Norse
        story of Balder was a myth of this sort will become probable if we
        can prove that ceremonies resembling the incidents in the tale have
        been performed by Norsemen and other European peoples. Now the main
        incidents in the tale are two—first, the pulling of the mistletoe,
        and second, the death and burning of the god; and both of them may
        perhaps be found to have had their counterparts in yearly rites
        observed, whether separately or conjointly, by people in various
        parts of Europe. These rites will be described and discussed in the
        following chapters. We shall begin with the annual festivals of fire
        and shall reserve the pulling of the mistletoe for consideration
        later on.</p>

          the peasants have been accustomed from time immemorial to kindle
          bonfires on certain days of the year, and to dance round or leap
          over them. Customs of this kind can be traced back on historical

          their analogy to similar customs observed in antiquity goes with
          strong internal evidence to prove that their origin must be sought
          in a period long prior to the spread of Christianity. Indeed the
          earliest proof of their observance in Northern Europe is furnished
          by the attempts made by Christian synods in the eighth century to
          put them down as heathenish rites.<a id="noteref_263" name=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The custom of
          kindling bonfires on the first Sunday in Lent has prevailed in
          Belgium, the north of France, and many parts of Germany. Thus in
          the Belgian Ardennes for a week or a fortnight before the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“day of the great fire,”</span> as it is
          called, children go about from farm to farm collecting fuel. At
          Grand Halleux any one who refuses their request is pursued next day
          by the children, who try to blacken his face with the ashes of the
          extinct fire. When the day has come, they cut down bushes,
          especially juniper and broom, and in the evening great bonfires
          blaze on all the heights. It is a common saying that seven bonfires
          should be seen if the village is to be safe from conflagrations. If
          the Meuse happens to be frozen hard at the time, bonfires are lit
          also on the ice. At Grand Halleux they set up a pole called
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">makral</span></span>, or <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“the witch,”</span> in the midst of the pile, and the
          fire is kindled by the man who was last married in the village. In
          the neighbourhood of Morlanwelz a straw man is burnt in the fire.
          Young people and children dance and sing round the bonfires, and
          leap over the embers to secure good crops or a happy marriage
          within the year, or as a means of guarding themselves against
          colic. In Brabant on the same Sunday, down to the beginning of the
          nineteenth century, women and men disguised in female attire used
          to go with burning torches to the fields, where they danced and
          sang comic songs for the purpose, as they alleged, of driving away
          <span class="tei tei-q">“the wicked sower,”</span> who is mentioned
          in the Gospel for the day. At Maeseyck and in many villages of
          Limburg, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page108">[pg
          108]</span><a name="Pg108" id="Pg108" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          on the evening of the day children run through the streets carrying
          lighted torches; then they kindle little fires of straw in the
          fields and dance round them. At Ensival old folks tell young folks
          that they will have as many Easter eggs as they see bonfires on
          this day.<a id="noteref_267" name="noteref_267" href=

          The next Sunday was called the Day of the Great Scouvion, and the
          same race with lighted torches among the trees of the orchards was
          repeated in the afternoon till darkness fell. The same custom was
          observed on the same two days at Wasmes.<a id="noteref_268" name=

          the neighbourhood of Liège, where the Lenten fires were put down by
          the police about the middle of the nineteenth century, girls
          thought that by leaping over the fires without being smirched they
          made sure of a happy marriage. Elsewhere in order to get a good
          husband it was necessary to see seven of the bonfires from one
          spot. In Famenne, a district of Namur, men and cattle who traversed
          the Lenten fires were thought to be safe from sickness and
          witchcraft. Anybody who saw seven such fires at once had nothing to
          fear from sorcerers. An old saying ran, that if you do not light
          <span class="tei tei-q">“the great fire,”</span> God will light it
          for you; which seems to imply that the kindling of the bonfires was

          Here, too, it was the person last married, sometimes a man and
          sometimes a woman, who put the match to the fire. The custom is
          still kept up very commonly in the district. Cats used to be burnt
          in the fire or roasted to death by being held over it; and while
          they were burning the shepherds drove their flocks through the
          smoke and flames as a sure means of guarding them against sickness
          and witchcraft. In some communes it was believed that the livelier

          and at Rupt and elsewhere the right of kindling them belongs to the
          person who was last married. Round the fires the people dance and
          sing merrily till the flames have died out. Then the master of the
          fire, as they call the man who kindled it, invites all who
          contributed to the erection of the pile to follow him to the
          nearest tavern, where they partake of good cheer. At Dommartin they
          say that, if you would have the hemp tall, it is absolutely

          be kindled at various places both in the town and on the banks of
          the Moselle. They consisted of pyramids of sticks and faggots,
          which had been collected some days earlier by young folks going
          from door to door. When the flames blazed up, the names of various
          couples, whether young or old, handsome or ugly, rich or poor, were
          called out, and the persons thus linked in mock marriage were
          forced, whether they liked it or not, to march arm in arm round the
          fire amid the laughter and jests of the crowd. The festivity lasted
          till the fire died out, and then the spectators dispersed through
          the streets, stopping under the windows of the houses and
          proclaiming the names of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          the popular voice had assigned to each other. These couples had to
          exchange presents; the mock bridegroom gave his mock bride
          something for her toilet, while she in turn presented him with a
          cockade of coloured ribbon. Next Sunday, if the weather allowed it,
          all the couples, arrayed in their best attire and attended by their
          relations, repaired to the wood of Saint Antony, where they mounted
          a famous stone called the <span lang="fr" class="tei tei-foreign"

          cakes and refreshments of all sorts, and danced to the music of a
          couple of fiddlers. The evening bell, ringing the Angelus, gave the
          signal to depart. As soon as its solemn chime was heard, every one
          quitted the forest and returned home. The exchange of presents
          between the Valentines went by the name of ransom or redemption
          (<span lang="fr" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="fr"><span style=

          to redeem the couple from the flames of the bonfire. Any pair who
          failed thus to ransom themselves were not suffered to share the
          merrymaking at the great stone in the forest; and a pretence was
          made of burning them in small fires kindled before their own

          province of Franche-Comté, to the west of the Jura Mountains, the
          first Sunday of Lent is known as the Sunday of the Firebrands
          (<span lang="fr" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="fr"><span style=

          fires which it is customary to kindle on that day. On the Saturday
          or the Sunday the village lads harness themselves to a cart and
          drag it about the streets, stopping at the doors of the houses
          where there are girls and begging for a faggot. When they have got
          enough, they cart the fuel to a spot at some little distance from
          the village, pile it up, and set it on fire. All the people of the
          parish come out to see the bonfire. In some villages, when the
          bells have rung the Angelus, the signal for the observance is given
          by cries of, <span class="tei tei-q">“To the fire! to the
          fire!”</span> Lads, lasses, and children dance round the blaze, and
          when the flames have died down they vie with each other in leaping
          over the red embers. He or she who does so without singeing his or
          her garments will be married within the year. Young folk also carry
          lighted torches about the streets or the fields, and when they pass

          out, <span class="tei tei-q">“More fruit than leaves!”</span> Down
          to recent years at Laviron, in the department of Doubs, it was the
          young married couples of the year who had charge of the bonfires.
          In the midst of the bonfire a pole was planted with a wooden figure
          of a cock fastened to the top. Then there were races, and the
          winner received the cock as a prize.<a id="noteref_273" name=

          they put some of the ashes in the fowls' nests, in order that the
          hens may lay plenty of eggs throughout the year. When all these
          ceremonies have been performed, everybody goes home and feasts; the

          the application of the fire to the fruit-trees, to the sown fields,

          addressed, and who gives his name to the torches, may possibly be,
          as Dr. Pommerol suggests,<a id="noteref_276" name="noteref_276"
          href="#note_276"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          other than the ancient Celtic god Grannus, whom the Romans
          identified with Apollo, and whose worship is attested by
          inscriptions found not only in France but in Scotland and on the
          Danube.<a id="noteref_277" name="noteref_277" href=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">277</span></span></a> If
          the name Grannus is derived, as the learned tell us, from a root
          meaning <span class="tei tei-q">“to glow, burn,
          shine,”</span><a id="noteref_278" name="noteref_278" href=
          "#note_278"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          deity who bore the name and was identified with Apollo may well
          have been a sun-god; and in that case the prayers addressed to him
          by the peasants of the Auvergne, while they wave the blazing,
          crackling torches about the fruit-trees, would be eminently
          appropriate. For who could ripen the fruit so well as the sun-god?
          and what better process could be devised to draw the blossoms from
          the bare boughs than the application to them of that genial warmth
          which is ultimately derived from the solar beams? Thus the
          fire-festival of the first Sunday in Lent, as it is observed in
          Auvergne, may be interpreted very naturally and simply as a
          religious or rather perhaps magical ceremony designed to procure a
          due supply of the sun's heat for plants and animals. At the same
          time we should remember that the employment of fire in this and
          kindred ceremonies may have been designed originally, not so much
          to stimulate growth and reproduction, as to burn and destroy all
          agencies, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page113">[pg
          113]</span><a name="Pg113" id="Pg113" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          whether in the shape of vermin, witches, or what not, which
          threatened or were supposed to threaten the growth of the crops and
          the multiplication of animals. It is often difficult to decide
          between these two different interpretations of the use of fire in
          agricultural rites. In any case the fire-festival of Auvergne on
          the first Sunday in Lent may date from Druidical times.</p>

          The young people climbed to the top of a mountain, where they
          placed three nests of straw in three trees. These nests being then
          set on fire, torches made of dry lime-wood were lighted at them,
          and the merry troop descended the mountain to their flickering
          light, and went to every house in the village, demanding roasted
          peas and obliging all couples who had been married within the year
          to dance.<a id="noteref_286" name="noteref_286" href=

          Berry, a district of central France, it appears that bonfires are
          not lighted on this day, but when the sun has set the whole
          population of the villages, armed with blazing torches of straw,
          disperse over the country and scour the fields, the vineyards, and
          the orchards. Seen from afar, the multitude of moving lights,
          twinkling in the darkness, appear like will-o'-the-wisps chasing
          each other across the plains, along the hillsides, and down the
          valleys. While the men wave their flambeaus about the branches of
          the fruit-trees, the women and children tie bands of wheaten-straw
          round the tree-trunks. The effect of the ceremony is supposed to be
          to avert the various plagues from which the fruits of the earth are
          apt to suffer; and the bands of straw fastened round the stems of
          the trees are believed to render them fruitful.<a id="noteref_287"

          Austria, and Switzerland at the same season similar customs have
          prevailed. Thus in the Eifel Mountains, Rhenish Prussia, on the
          first Sunday in Lent young people used to collect straw and
          brushwood from house to house. These they carried to an eminence
          and piled up round a tall, slim beech-tree, to which a piece of
          wood was fastened at <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page116">[pg
          116]</span><a name="Pg116" id="Pg116" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          right angles to form a cross. The structure was known as the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“hut”</span> or <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“castle.”</span> Fire was set to it and the young
          people marched round the blazing <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“castle”</span> bareheaded, each carrying a lighted
          torch and praying aloud. Sometimes a straw-man was burned in the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“hut.”</span> People observed the direction
          in which the smoke blew from the fire. If it blew towards the
          corn-fields, it was a sign that the harvest would be abundant. On
          the same day, in some parts of the Eifel, a great wheel was made of
          straw and dragged by three horses to the top of a hill. Thither the
          village boys marched at nightfall, set fire to the wheel, and sent
          it rolling down the slope. Two lads followed it with levers to set
          it in motion again, in case it should anywhere meet with a check.
          At Oberstattfeld the wheel had to be provided by the young man who
          was last married.<a id="noteref_289" name="noteref_289" href=

          Voralberg in the Tyrol, on the first Sunday in Lent, a slender
          young fir-tree is surrounded with a pile of straw and firewood. To
          the top of the tree is fastened a human figure called the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“witch,”</span> made of old clothes and
          stuffed with gunpowder. At night the whole is set on fire and boys
          and girls dance round it, swinging torches and singing rhymes in
          which the words <span class="tei tei-q">“corn in the
          winnowing-basket, the plough in the earth”</span> may be
          distinguished.<a id="noteref_291" name="noteref_291" href=

          Swabia on the first Sunday in Lent a figure called the <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“witch”</span> or the <span class="tei tei-q">“old
          wife”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“winter's
          grandmother”</span> is made up of clothes and fastened to a pole.
          This is stuck in the middle of a pile of wood, to which fire is
          applied. While the <span class="tei tei-q">“witch”</span> is
          burning, the young people throw blazing discs into the air. The
          discs are thin round pieces of wood, a few inches in diameter, with
          notched edges to imitate the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page117">[pg 117]</span><a name="Pg117" id="Pg117" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> rays of the sun or stars. They have a hole in
          the middle, by which they are attached to the end of a wand. Before
          the disc is thrown it is set on fire, the wand is swung to and fro,
          and the impetus thus communicated to the disc is augmented by
          dashing the rod sharply against a sloping board. The burning disc
          is thus thrown off, and mounting high into the air, describes a
          long fiery curve before it reaches the ground. A single lad may
          fling up forty or fifty of these discs, one after the other. The
          object is to throw them as high as possible. The wand by which they
          are hurled must, at least in some parts of Swabia, be of hazel.
          Sometimes the lads also leap over the fire brandishing lighted
          torches of pine-wood. The charred embers of the burned <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“witch”</span> and discs are taken home and planted in
          the flax-fields the same night, in the belief that they will keep
          vermin from the fields.<a id="noteref_292" name="noteref_292" href=

          Wangen, near Molsheim in Baden, a like custom is observed on the
          first Sunday in Lent. The young people kindle a bonfire on the
          crest of the mountain above the village; and the burning discs
          which they hurl into the air are said to present in the darkness
          the aspect of a continual shower of falling stars. When the supply
          of discs is exhausted and the bonfire begins to burn low, the boys
          light torches and run with them at full speed down one or other of
          the three steep and winding paths that descend the mountain-side to
          the village. Bumps, bruises, and scratches are often the result of
          their efforts to outstrip each other in the headlong race.<a id=

          the Rhön Mountains, situated on the borders of Hesse and Bavaria,
          the people used to march to the top of a hill or eminence on the
          first Sunday in Lent. Children and lads carried torches, brooms
          daubed with tar, and poles swathed in straw. A wheel, wrapt in
          combustibles, was kindled and rolled down <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page118">[pg 118]</span><a name="Pg118" id="Pg118" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> the hill; and the young people rushed about
          the fields with their burning torches and brooms, till at last they
          flung them in a heap, and standing round them, struck up a hymn or
          a popular song. The object of running about the fields with the
          blazing torches was to <span class="tei tei-q">“drive away the
          wicked sower.”</span> Or it was done in honour of the Virgin, that
          she might preserve the fruits of the earth throughout the year and
          bless them.<a id="noteref_294" name="noteref_294" href=

          neighbouring villages of Hesse, between the Rhön and the Vogel

          Konz on the Moselle, on the Thursday before the first Sunday in
          Lent, the two guilds of the butchers and the weavers used to repair
          to the Marxberg and there set up an oak-tree with a wheel fastened
          to it. On the following Sunday the people ascended the hill, cut
          down the oak, set fire to the wheel, and sent both oak and wheel
          rolling down the hillside, while a guard of butchers, mounted on
          horses, fired at the flaming wheel in its descent. If the wheel
          rolled down into the Moselle, the butchers were rewarded with a
          waggon-load of wine by the archbishop of Treves.<a id="noteref_296"

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In Switzerland,
          also, it is or used to be customary to kindle bonfires on high
          places on the evening of the first Sunday in Lent, and the day is
          therefore popularly known as Spark Sunday. The custom prevailed,
          for example, throughout the canton of Lucerne. Boys went about from
          house to house begging for wood and straw, then piled the fuel on a
          conspicuous mountain or hill round about a pole, which bore a straw
          effigy called <span class="tei tei-q">“the witch.”</span> At
          nightfall the pile was set on fire, and the young folks danced
          wildly round it, some of them cracking whips or ringing bells; and
          when the fire burned low enough, they leaped over it. This
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page119">[pg 119]</span><a name=
          "Pg119" id="Pg119" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> was called
          <span class="tei tei-q">“burning the witch.”</span> In some parts
          of the canton also they used to wrap old wheels in straw and
          thorns, put a light to them, and send them rolling and blazing down
          hill. The same custom of rolling lighted wheels down hill is
          attested by old authorities for the cantons of Aargau and Bâle. The
          more bonfires could be seen sparkling and flaring in the darkness,
          the more fruitful was the year expected to be; and the higher the
          dancers leaped beside or over the fire, the higher, it was thought,
          would grow the flax. In the district of Freiburg and at Birseck in
          the district of Bâle it was the last married man or woman who must
          kindle the bonfire. While the bonfires blazed up, it was customary
          in some parts of Switzerland to propel burning discs of wood
          through the air by means of the same simple machinery which is used
          for the purpose in Swabia. Each lad tried to send his disc fizzing
          and flaring through the darkness as far as possible, and in
          discharging it he mentioned the name of the person to whose honour
          it was dedicated. But in Prättigau the words uttered in launching
          the fiery discs referred to the abundance which was apparently
          expected to follow the performance of the ceremony. Among them
          were, <span class="tei tei-q">“Grease in the pan, corn in the fan,

          and a fur cap, is laid in a hole outside the village and there
          burned, and that while it is blazing every one seeks to snatch a
          fragment of it, which he fastens to a branch of the highest tree in
          his garden or buries in his field, believing that this will make
          the crops to grow better. The ceremony is known as the <span class=

          is not designated as Death, the meaning of the observance is
          probably the same; for the name Death, as I have tried to shew,
          does not express the original intention of the ceremony. At Cobern
          in the Eifel Mountains the lads make up a straw-man on Shrove
          Tuesday. The effigy is formally tried and accused of having
          perpetrated all the thefts that have been committed in the
          neighbourhood throughout the year. Being condemned to death, the
          straw-man is led through the village, shot, and burned upon a pyre.
          They dance round the blazing pile, and the last bride must leap
          over it.<a id="noteref_299" name="noteref_299" href=

          "tei tei-anchor"></a> Easter Eve, the Saturday before Easter
          Sunday. On that day it has been customary in Catholic countries to
          extinguish all the lights in the churches, and then to make a new
          fire, sometimes with flint and steel, sometimes with a
          burning-glass. At this fire is lit the great Paschal or Easter
          candle, which is then used to rekindle all the extinguished lights
          in the church. In many parts of Germany a bonfire is also kindled,
          by means of the new fire, on some open space near the church. It is
          consecrated, and the people bring sticks of oak, walnut, and beech,
          which they char in the fire, and then take home with them. Some of
          these charred sticks are thereupon burned at home in a
          newly-kindled fire, with a prayer that God will preserve the
          homestead from fire, lightning, and hail. Thus every house receives
          <span class="tei tei-q">“new fire.”</span> Some of the sticks are
          kept throughout the year and laid on the hearth-fire during heavy
          thunder-storms to prevent the house from being struck by lightning,
          or they are inserted in the roof with the like intention. Others
          are placed in the fields, gardens, and meadows, with a prayer that
          God will keep them from blight and hail. Such fields and gardens
          are thought to thrive more than others; the corn and the plants
          that grow in them are not beaten down by hail, nor devoured by
          mice, vermin, and beetles; no witch harms them, and the ears of
          corn stand close and full. The charred sticks are also applied to
          the plough. The ashes of the Easter bonfire, together with the
          ashes of the consecrated palm-branches, are mixed with the seed at
          sowing. A wooden figure called Judas is sometimes burned in the
          consecrated bonfire, and even where this custom has been abolished
          the bonfire itself in some places goes by the name of <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“the burning of Judas.”</span><a id="noteref_305" name=

          Hollertau, Bavaria, the young men used to light their lanterns at
          the newly-kindled Easter candle in the church and then race to the
          bonfire; he who reached it first set fire to the pile, and next
          day, Easter Sunday, was rewarded at the church-door by the
          housewives, who presented him with red eggs. Great was the
          jubilation while the effigy of the traitor was being consumed in
          the flames. The ashes were carefully collected and thrown away at
          sunrise in running water.<a id="noteref_306" name="noteref_306"

          many parts of the Abruzzi, also, pious people kindle their fires on
          Easter Saturday with a brand brought from the sacred new fire in
          the church. When the brand has thus served to bless the fire on the
          domestic hearth, it is extinguished, and the remainder is
          preserved, partly in a cranny of the outer wall of the house,
          partly on a tree to which it is tied. This is done for the purpose
          of guarding the homestead against injury by storms. At Campo di
          Giove the people say that if you can get a piece of one of the
          three holy candles which the priest lights from the new fire, you
          should allow a few drops of the wax to fall into the crown of your
          hat; for after that, if it should thunder and lighten, you have
          nothing to do but to clap the hat on your head, and no flash of
          lightning can possibly strike you.<a id="noteref_307" name=

          deserves to be noted that in the Abruzzi water as well as fire is,
          as it were, renewed and consecrated on Easter Saturday. Most people
          fetch holy water on <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page123">[pg
          123]</span><a name="Pg123" id="Pg123" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          that day from the churches, and every member of the family drinks a
          little of it, believing that it has power to protect him or her
          against witchcraft, fever, and stomach-aches of all sorts. And when
          the church bells ring again after their enforced silence, the water
          is sprinkled about the house, and especially under the beds, with
          the help of a palm-branch. Some of this blessed water is also kept
          in the house for use in great emergencies, when there is no time to
          fetch a priest; thus it may be employed to baptize a new-born
          infant gasping for life or to sprinkle a sick man in the last
          agony; such a sprinkling is reckoned equal to priestly
          absolution.<a id="noteref_308" name="noteref_308" href=
          "#note_308"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">308</span></span></a> In
          Calabria the customs with regard to the new water, as it is called,
          on Easter Saturday are similar; it is poured into a new vessel,
          adorned with ribbons and flowers, is blessed by the priest, and is
          tasted by every one of the household, beginning with the parents.
          And when the air vibrates with the glad music of the church bells
          announcing the resurrection, the people sprinkle the holy water
          about the houses, bidding in a loud voice all evil things to go
          forth and all good things to come in. At the same time, to
          emphasize the exorcism, they knock on doors, window-shutters,
          chests, and other domestic articles of furniture. At Cetraro people
          who suffer from diseases of the skin bathe in the sea at this
          propitious moment; at Pietro in Guarano they plunge into the river
          on the night of Easter Saturday before Easter Sunday dawns, and
          while they bathe they utter never a word. Moreover, the Calabrians
          keep the <span class="tei tei-q">“new water”</span> as a sacred
          thing. They believe that it serves as a protection against
          witchcraft if it is sprinkled on a fire or a lamp, when the wood
          crackles or the wick sputters; for they regard it as a bad omen
          when the fire talks, as they say.<a id="noteref_309" name=
          "noteref_309" href="#note_309"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">309</span></span></a> Among
          the Germans of Western Bohemia, also, water as well as fire is
          consecrated by the priest in front of the church on Easter
          Saturday. People bring jugs full of water to the church and set
          them beside the holy fire; afterwards they use the water to
          sprinkle on the palm-branches which are stuck in the fields.
          Charred sticks of the Judas fire, as it is popularly called, are
          supposed to possess a magical and healing virtue; <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page124">[pg 124]</span><a name="Pg124" id="Pg124"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> hence the people take them home with
          them, and even scuffle with each other for the still glowing embers
          in order to carry them, still glimmering, to their houses and so
          obtain <span class="tei tei-q">“the light”</span> or <span class=

          Hildesheim, also, and the neighbouring villages of central Germany
          rites both of fire and water are or were till lately observed at
          Easter. Thus on Easter night many people fetch water from the
          Innerste river and keep it carefully, believing it to be a remedy
          for many sorts of ailments both of man and beast. In the villages
          on the Leine river servant men and maids used to go silently on
          Easter night between the hours of eleven and twelve and silently
          draw water in buckets from the river; they mixed the water with the
          fodder and the drink of the cattle to make the animals thrive, and
          they imagined that to wash in it was good for human beings. Many
          were also of opinion that at the same mystic hour the water turned
          to wine as far as the crowing of a cock could be heard, and in this
          belief they laid themselves flat on their stomachs and kept their
          tongues in the water till the miraculous change occurred, when they
          took a great gulp of the transformed water. At Hildesheim, too, and
          the neighbouring villages fires used to blaze on all the heights on
          Easter Eve; and embers taken from the bonfires were dipped in the
          cattle troughs to benefit the beasts and were kept in the houses to
          avert lightning.<a id="noteref_311" name="noteref_311" href=

            </div>
          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In Florence the
          ceremony of kindling the new fire on Easter Eve is peculiar. The
          holy flame is elicited from certain flints which are said to have
          been brought by a member of the Pazzi family from the Holy Land.
          They are kept in the church of the Holy Apostles on the Piazza del
          Limbo, and on the morning of Easter Saturday the prior strikes fire
          from them and lights a candle from the new flame. The burning
          candle is then carried in solemn procession by the clergy and
          members of the municipality to the high altar in the cathedral. A
          vast crowd has meanwhile assembled in the cathedral and the
          neighbouring square to witness the ceremony; amongst the spectators
          are many peasants drawn from the surrounding country, for it is
          commonly believed that on the success or failure of the ceremony
          depends the fate of the crops for the year. Outside the door of the
          cathedral stands a festal car drawn by two fine white oxen with
          gilded horns. The body of the car is loaded with a pyramid of
          squibs and crackers and is connected by a wire with a pillar set up
          in front of the high altar. The wire extends down the middle of the
          nave at a height of about six feet from the ground. Beneath it a
          clear passage is left, the spectators being ranged on either side
          and crowding the vast interior from wall to wall. When all is
          ready, High Mass is celebrated, and precisely at noon, when the
          first words of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Gloria</span></span> are being chanted, the
          sacred fire is applied to the pillar, which like the car is
          wreathed with fireworks. A moment more and a fiery dove comes
          flying down the nave, with a hissing sound and a sputter of sparks,
          between the two hedges of eager spectators. If all goes well, the
          bird pursues its course along the wire and out at the door, and in
          another moment a prolonged series of fizzes, pops and bangs
          announces to the excited crowd in the cathedral that the fireworks
          on the car are going off. Great is the joy accordingly, especially
          among the bumpkins, who are now sure of an abundant harvest. But
          if, as sometimes happens, the dove stops short in its career and
          fizzles out, revealing itself as a stuffed bird with a packet of
          squibs tied to its tail, great is the consternation, and deep the
          curses that issue from between the set teeth of the clodhoppers,
          who now give up the harvest for lost. Formerly the unskilful
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page127">[pg 127]</span><a name=
          "Pg127" id="Pg127" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> mechanician who was
          responsible for the failure would have been clapped into gaol; but
          nowadays he is thought sufficiently punished by the storm of public
          indignation and the loss of his pay. The disaster is announced by
          placards posted about the streets in the evening; and next morning
          the newspapers are full of gloomy prognostications.<a id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Some of these
          customs have been transported by the Catholic Church to the New
          World. Thus in Mexico the new fire is struck from a flint early in
          the morning of Easter Saturday, and a candle which has been lighted
          at the sacred flame is carried through the church by a deacon
          shouting <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class=
          "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Lumen Christi</span></span>.”</span> Meantime
          the whole city, we are informed, has been converted into a vast
          place of execution. Ropes stretch across the streets from house to
          house, and from every house dangles an effigy of Judas, made of
          paper pulp. Scores or hundreds of them may adorn a single street.
          They are of all shapes and sizes, grotesque in form and garbed in
          strange attire, stuffed with gunpowder, squibs and crackers,
          sometimes, too, with meat, bread, soap, candy, and clothing, for
          which the crowd will scramble and scuffle while the effigies are
          burning. There they hang grim, black, and sullen in the strong
          sunshine, greeted with a roar of execration by the pious mob. A
          peal of bells from the cathedral tower on the stroke of noon gives
          the signal for the execution. At the sound a frenzy seizes the
          crowd. They throw themselves furiously on the figures of the
          detested traitor, cut them down, hurl them with curses into the
          fire, and fight and struggle with each other in their efforts to
          tear the effigies to tatters and appropriate their contents. Smoke,
          stink, sputter of crackers, oaths, curses, yells are now the order
          of the day. But the traitor does not perish unavenged. For the
          anatomy of his frame has been cunningly contrived so as in burning
          to discharge volleys of squibs into his assailants; and the wounds
          and burns with which their <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page128">[pg 128]</span><a name="Pg128" id="Pg128" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> piety is rewarded form a feature of the
          morning's entertainment. The English Jockey Club in Mexico used to
          improve on this popular pastime by suspending huge figures of
          Judas, stuffed with copper coins, from ropes in front of their
          clubhouse. These were ignited at the proper moment and lowered
          within reach of the expectant rabble, and it was the privilege of
          members of the club, seated in the balcony, to watch the grimaces
          and to hear the shrieks of the victims, as they stamped and capered
          about with the hot coppers sticking to their hands, divided in
          their minds between an acute sense of pain and a thirst for filthy
          lucre.<a id="noteref_316" name="noteref_316" href=

          and gives place to an extravagant burst of joy at his resurrection.
          Shots are fired everywhere, and effigies of Judas are hung on trees

          destroyed.<a id="noteref_317" name="noteref_317" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But usages of
          this sort are not confined to the Latin Church; they are common to
          the Greek Church also. Every year on the Saturday before Easter
          Sunday a new fire is miraculously kindled at the Holy Sepulchre in
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page129">[pg 129]</span><a name=

          descends from heaven and ignites the candles which the patriarch
          holds in his hands, while with closed eyes he wrestles in prayer
          all alone in the chapel of the Angel. The worshippers meanwhile
          wait anxiously in the body of the church, and great are their
          transports of joy when at one of the windows of the chapel, which
          had been all dark a minute before, there suddenly appears the hand
          of an angel, or of the patriarch, holding a lighted taper. This is
          the sacred new fire; it is passed out to the expectant believers,
          and the desperate struggle which ensues among them to get a share
          of its blessed influence is only terminated by the intervention of
          the Turkish soldiery, who restore peace and order by hustling the
          whole multitude impartially out of the church. In days gone by many
          lives were often lost in these holy scrimmages. For example, in the
          year 1834, the famous Ibrahim Pasha witnessed the frantic scene
          from one of the galleries, and, being moved with compassion at the
          sight, descended with a few guards into the arena in the chimerical
          hope of restoring peace and order among the contending Christians.
          He contrived to force his way into the midst of the dense crowd,
          but there the heat and pressure were so great that he fainted away;
          a body of soldiers, seeing his danger, charged straight into the
          throng and carried him out of it in their arms, trampling under

          were killed that day in the church. The fortunate survivors on
          these occasions who succeeded in obtaining a portion of the coveted
          fire applied it freely to their faces, their beards, and their
          garments. The theory was that the fire, being miraculous, could
          only bless and not burn them; but the practical results of the
          experiment were often disappointing, for while the blessings were
          more or less dubious, there could be no doubt whatever about the
          burns.<a id="noteref_320" name="noteref_320" href=

          A dense crowd with unlit candles in their hands fills the square in
          front of the cathedral; the king, the archbishop, and the highest
          dignitaries of the church, arrayed in their gorgeous robes, occupy
          a platform; and at the exact moment of the resurrection the bells
          ring out, and the whole square bursts as by magic into a blaze of

          Effigies of Judas used to be burned at Athens on Easter Saturday,
          but the custom has been forbidden by the Government. However,
          firing goes on more or less continuously all over the city both on
          Easter Saturday and Easter Sunday, and the cartridges used on this
          occasion are not always blank. The shots are aimed at Judas, but
          sometimes they miss him and hit other people. Outside of Athens the
          practice of burning Judas in effigy still survives in some places.
          For example, in Cos a straw image of the traitor is made on Easter
          Day, and after being hung up and shot at it is burned.<a id=

          Church the sacred new fire is kindled not at Easter but at
          Candlemas, that is, on the second of February, or on the eve of
          that festival. The materials of the bonfire are piled in an open
          space near a church, and they are generally ignited by young
          couples who have been married within the year. However, it is the
          bishop or his vicar who lights the candles with which fire is set
          to the pile. All young married pairs are expected to range
          themselves about the fire and to dance round it. Young men leap
          over the flames, but girls and women content themselves with going
          round them, while they pray to be preserved from the itch and other
          skin-diseases. When the ceremony is over, the people eagerly pick
          up charred sticks or ashes of the fire and preserve them or scatter
          them on the four corners of the roof, in the cattle-stall, in the
          garden, and on the pastures; for these holy sticks and ashes
          protect men and cattle against disease, and fruit-trees against
          worms and caterpillars. Omens, too, are drawn from the direction in
          which the wind blows the flames and the smoke: if it carries them
          eastward, there is hope of a good harvest; but if it inclines them
          westward, the people fear that the crops will fail.<a id=

          Easter. It was held in honour of the sun at the solstice in June.
          For three days before the festival the people fasted, men did not
          sleep with their wives, and no fires were lighted in Cuzco, the
          capital. The sacred new fire was obtained direct from the sun by
          concentrating his beams on a highly polished concave plate and
          reflecting them on a little cotton wool. With this holy fire the
          sheep and lambs offered to the sun were consumed, and the flesh of
          such as were to be eaten at the festival was roasted. Portions of
          the new fire were also conveyed to the temple of the sun and to the
          convent of the sacred virgins, where they were kept burning all the
          year, and it was an ill omen if the holy flame went out.<a id=

          Zuni Indians of New Mexico kindle a new fire by the friction of
          wood both at the winter and the summer solstice. At the winter
          solstice the chosen fire-maker collects a faggot of cedar-wood from
          every house in the village, and each person, as he hands the wood
          to the fire-maker, prays that the crops may be good in the coming
          year. For several days before the new fire is kindled, no
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page133">[pg 133]</span><a name=
          "Pg133" id="Pg133" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> ashes or sweepings
          may be removed from the houses and no artificial light may appear
          outside of them, not even a burning cigarette or the flash of
          firearms. The Indians believe that no rain will fall on the fields
          of the man outside whose house a light has been seen at this
          season. The signal for kindling the new fire is given by the rising
          of the Morning Star. The flame is produced by twirling an upright
          stick between the hands on a horizontal stick laid on the floor of
          a sacred chamber, the sparks being caught by a tinder of
          cedar-dust. It is forbidden to blow up the smouldering tinder with
          the breath, for that would offend the gods. After the fire has thus
          been ceremonially kindled, the women and girls of all the families
          in the village clean out their houses. They carry the sweepings and
          ashes in baskets or bowls to the fields and leave them there. To
          the sweepings the woman says: <span class="tei tei-q">“I now
          deposit you as sweepings, but in one year you will return to me as
          corn.”</span> And to the ashes she says: <span class="tei tei-q">“I
          now deposit you as ashes, but in one year you will return to me as
          meal.”</span> At the summer solstice the sacred fire which has been
          procured by the friction of wood is used to kindle the grass and
          trees, that there may be a great cloud of smoke, while bull-roarers
          are swung and prayers offered that the Rain-makers up aloft will
          water the earth.<a id="noteref_330" name="noteref_330" href=

          this account we see how intimately the kindling of a new fire at
          the two turning-points of the sun's course is associated in the
          minds of these Indians with the fertility of the land, particularly
          with the growth of the corn. The rolling smoke is apparently an
          imitation of rain-clouds designed, on the principle of homoeopathic
          magic, to draw showers from the blue sky. Once a year the Iroquois
          priesthood supplied the people with a new fire. As a preparation
          for the annual rite <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page134">[pg

          the fires in all the huts were extinguished and the ashes scattered
          about. Then the priest, wearing the insignia of his office, went
          from hut to hut relighting the fires by means of a flint.<a id=

          village. One of the men was dressed to represent a woman.
          Afterwards the lights were rekindled from a fresh fire. An Esquimau

          foot of a high hill. When they have lighted the fire by rubbing two
          dry sticks together, and it begins to burn well, they stand a
          little way off and pray, saying, <span class="tei tei-q">“May the

          Chinese philosopher, the reason for thus renewing fire periodically
          is that the vital principle grows weaker and weaker in old fire,
          whereas in new fire it is young and vigorous. This annual renewal
          of fire was a ceremony of very great antiquity in China, since it
          is known to have been observed in the time of the first dynasty,
          about two thousand years before Christ. Under the Tcheou dynasty a
          change in the calendar led to shifting the fire-festival from
          spring to the summer solstice, but afterwards it was brought back
          to its original date. Although the custom appears to have long
          fallen into disuse, the barbarous inhabitants of Hainan, an island
          to the south of China, still call a year <span class="tei tei-q">“a
          fire,”</span> as if in memory of the time when the years were

          nothing to do with Christianity, but is merely one case of a

          fire on the first of March, were it not that the observance by the
          Eastern Church of the custom on the same day seems to point back to
          a still older period when the ceremony of lighting a new fire in
          spring, perhaps at the vernal equinox, was common to many peoples
          of the Mediterranean area. We may conjecture that wherever such a
          ceremony has been observed, it originally marked the beginning of a
          new year, as it did in ancient Rome and Ireland, and as it still
          does in the Sudanese kingdom of Wadai and among the Swahili of

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The essentially
          pagan character of the Easter fire festival appears plainly both
          from the mode in which it is celebrated by the peasants and from
          the superstitious beliefs which they associate with it. All over
          northern and central Germany, from Altmark and Anhalt on the east,
          through Brunswick, Hanover, Oldenburg, the Harz district, and Hesse
          to Westphalia the Easter bonfires still blaze simultaneously on the
          hill-tops. As many as forty may sometimes be counted within sight
          at once. Long before Easter the young people have been busy
          collecting firewood; every farmer contributes, and tar-barrels,
          petroleum cases, and so forth go to swell the pile. Neighbouring
          villages vie with each other as to which shall send up the greatest
          blaze. The fires are always kindled, year after year, on the same
          hill, which accordingly often takes the name of Easter Mountain. It
          is a fine spectacle to watch from some eminence the bonfires
          flaring up one after another on the neighbouring heights. As far as
          their light reaches, so far, in the belief of the peasants, the
          fields will be fruitful, and the houses on which they shine will be
          safe from conflagration or sickness. At Volkmarsen and other places
          in Hesse the people used to observe which way the wind blew the
          flames, and then they sowed flax seed in that direction, confident
          that it would grow well. Brands taken from the bonfires preserve
          houses from <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page141">[pg

          being struck by lightning; and the ashes increase the fertility of
          the fields, protect them from mice, and mixed with the
          drinking-water of cattle make the animals thrive and ensure them
          against plague. As the flames die down, young and old leap over
          them, and cattle are sometimes driven through the smouldering
          embers. In some places tar-barrels or wheels wrapt in straw used to
          be set on fire, and then sent rolling down the hillside. In others
          the boys light torches and wisps of straw at the bonfires and rush
          about brandishing them in their hands. Where the people are divided
          between Protestantism and Catholicism, as in Hildesheim, it has
          been observed that among Protestants the Easter bonfires are
          generally left to the boys, while in Catholic districts they are
          cared for by grown-up persons, and here the whole population will
          gather round the blazing pile and join in singing choral hymns,
          which echo far and wide in the stillness of night.<a id=

          round the fire; and when it has died out, the old folk come and
          collect the ashes, which they preserve as a remedy for the ailments
          of bees. It is also believed that as far as the blaze of the

          on, and march with them in a long procession to a neighbouring
          height. When the first chime of the evening bell comes up from the

          be burned in the churchyards on Easter Saturday. The whole village
          contributed wood to the pyre on which he perished, and the charred
          sticks were afterwards kept and planted in the fields on Walpurgis
          Day (the first of May) to preserve the wheat from blight and

          a hundred years ago or more the custom at Althenneberg, in Upper
          Bavaria, used to be as follows. On the afternoon of Easter Saturday
          the lads collected wood, which they piled in a cornfield, while in
          the middle of the pile they set up a tall wooden cross all swathed
          in straw. After the evening service they lighted their lanterns at
          the consecrated candle in the church, and ran with them at full
          speed to the pyre, each striving to get there first. The first to
          arrive set fire to the heap. No woman or girl might come near the
          bonfire, but they were allowed to watch it from a distance. As the
          flames rose the men and lads rejoiced and made merry, shouting,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“We are burning the Judas!”</span> Two of
          them had to watch the glowing embers the whole night long, lest
          people should come and steal them. Next morning at sunrise they
          carefully collected the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page144">[pg
          144]</span><a name="Pg144" id="Pg144" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          ashes, and threw them into the running water of the Röten brook.
          The man who had been the first to reach the pyre and to kindle it
          was rewarded on Easter Sunday by the women, who gave him coloured
          eggs at the church door. Well-to-do women gave him two; poorer
          women gave him only one. The object of the whole ceremony was to
          keep off the hail. About a century ago the Judas fire, as it was
          called, was put down by the police.<a id="noteref_362" name=

          Giggenhausen and Aufkirchen, two other villages of Upper Bavaria, a
          similar custom prevailed, yet with some interesting differences.
          Here the ceremony, which took place between nine and ten at night
          on Easter Saturday, was called <span class="tei tei-q">“burning the
          Easter Man.”</span> On a height about a mile from the village the
          young fellows set up a tall cross enveloped in straw, so that it
          looked like a man with his arms stretched out. This was the Easter
          Man. No lad under eighteen years of age might take part in the
          ceremony. One of the young men stationed himself beside the Easter
          Man, holding in his hand a consecrated taper which he had brought
          from the church and lighted. The rest stood at equal intervals in a
          great circle round the cross. At a given signal they raced thrice
          round the circle, and then at a second signal ran straight at the
          cross and at the lad with the lighted taper beside it; the one who
          reached the goal first had the right of setting fire to the Easter
          Man. Great was the jubilation while he was burning. When he had
          been consumed in the flames, three lads were chosen from among the
          rest, and each of the three drew a circle on the ground with a
          stick thrice round the ashes. Then they all left the spot. On
          Easter Monday the villagers gathered the ashes and strewed them on
          their fields; also they planted in the fields palm-branches which
          had been consecrated on Palm Sunday, and sticks which had been
          charred and hallowed on Good Friday, all for the purpose of
          protecting their fields against showers of hail. The custom of
          burning an Easter Man made of straw on Easter Saturday was observed
          also at Abensberg, in Lower Bavaria.<a id="noteref_363" name=

          bonfires are still kindled in the churchyards on Easter Saturday,
          and ecclesiastical refuse of various sorts, such as candle-ends,
          old surplices, and the wool used by the priest in the application
          of extreme unction, is consumed in the flames. At Zoznegg down to
          about 1850 the fire was lighted by the priest by means of a flint
          which had never been used before. People bring sticks, especially
          oaken sticks, char them in the fire, and then carry them home and
          keep them in the house as a preservative against lightning. At
          Zoznegg these oaken sticks were sword-shaped, each about an ell and
          a half long, and they went by the name of <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“weather or thunder poles”</span> (<span lang="de"
          class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="de"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Wetterpfähle</span></span>). When a
          thunder-storm threatened to break out, one of the sticks was put
          into a small fire, in order that the hallowed smoke, ascending to
          the clouds, might ward off the lightning from the house and the
          hail from the fields and gardens. At Schöllbronn the oaken sticks,
          which are thus charred in the Easter bonfire and kept in the house
          as a protective against thunder and lightning, are three in number,
          perhaps with an allusion to the Trinity; they are brought every
          Easter to be consecrated afresh in the bonfire, till they are quite
          burnt away. In the lake district of Baden it is also customary to
          burn one of these holy sticks in the fire when a heavy thunderstorm
          is raging.<a id="noteref_365" name="noteref_365" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the central
          Highlands of Scotland bonfires, known as the Beltane fires, were
          formerly kindled with great ceremony on the first of May, and the
          traces of human sacrifices at them were particularly clear and
          unequivocal. The custom of lighting the bonfires lasted in various
          places far into the eighteenth century, and the descriptions of the
          ceremony by writers of that period present such a curious and
          interesting picture of ancient heathendom surviving in our own
          country that I will reproduce them in the words of their authors.
          The fullest of the descriptions, so far as I know, is the one
          bequeathed to us by John Ramsay, laird of Ochtertyre, near Crieff,
          the patron of Burns and the friend of Sir <span class="tei tei-pb"

          manuscripts, written in the last quarter of the eighteenth century,
          a selection was published in the latter part of the nineteenth
          century. The following account of Beltane is extracted from a
          chapter dealing with Highland superstitions. Ramsay says:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“But the most considerable of the Druidical
          festivals is that of Beltane, or May-day, which was lately observed
          in some parts of the Highlands with extraordinary ceremonies. Of
          later years it is chiefly attended to by young people, persons
          advanced in years considering it as inconsistent with their gravity
          to give it any countenance. Yet a number of circumstances relative
          to it may be collected from tradition, or the conversation of very
          old people, who witnessed this feast in their youth, when the
          ancient rites were better observed.</span></p>

          the fire of Bel.... Like the other public worship of the Druids,
          the Beltane feast seems to have been performed on hills or
          eminences. They thought it degrading to him whose temple is the
          universe, to suppose that he would dwell in any house made with
          hands. Their sacrifices were therefore offered in the open air,
          frequently upon the tops of hills, where they were presented with
          the grandest views of nature, and were nearest the seat of warmth
          and order. And, according to tradition, such was the manner of
          celebrating this festival in the Highlands within the last hundred
          years. But since the decline of superstition, it has been
          celebrated by the people of each hamlet on some hill or rising
          ground around which their cattle were pasturing. Thither the young
          folks repaired in the morning, and cut a trench, on the summit of
          which a seat of turf was formed for the company. And in the middle
          a pile of wood or other fuel was placed, which of old they kindled

          this sacred fire were prepared. The most primitive method seems to
          be that which was used in the islands of <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page148">[pg 148]</span><a name="Pg148" id="Pg148" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> Skye, Mull, and Tiree. A well-seasoned plank
          of oak was procured, in the midst of which a hole was bored. A
          wimble of the same timber was then applied, the end of which they
          fitted to the hole. But in some parts of the mainland the machinery
          was different. They used a frame of green wood, of a square form,
          in the centre of which was an axle-tree. In some places three times
          three persons, in others three times nine, were required for
          turning round by turns the axle-tree or wimble. If any of them had
          been guilty of murder, adultery, theft, or other atrocious crime,
          it was imagined either that the fire would not kindle, or that it
          would be devoid of its usual virtue. So soon as any sparks were
          emitted by means of the violent friction, they applied a species of
          agaric which grows on old birch-trees, and is very combustible.
          This fire had the appearance of being immediately derived from
          heaven, and manifold were the virtues ascribed to it. They esteemed
          it a preservative against witchcraft, and a sovereign remedy
          against malignant diseases, both in the human species and in
          cattle; and by it the strongest poisons were supposed to have their
          nature changed.</span></p>

          such circumference as to hold the whole company. They kindle a
          fire, and dress a repast of eggs and milk in the consistence of a
          custard. They knead a cake of oatmeal, which is toasted at the
          embers against a stone. After the custard is eaten up, they divide
          the cake into so many portions, as similar as possible to one
          another in size and shape, as there are persons in the company.
          They daub one of these portions all over with charcoal, until it be
          perfectly black. They put all the bits of the cake into a bonnet.

          village hold their Bel-tien, a rural sacrifice. They cut a square

          make a fire of wood, on which they dress a large caudle of eggs,
          butter, oatmeal and milk; and bring besides the ingredients of the
          caudle, plenty of beer and whisky; for each of the company must
          contribute something. The rites begin with spilling some of the
          caudle on the ground, by way of libation: on that every one takes a
          cake of oatmeal, upon which are raised nine square knobs, each
          dedicated to some particular being, the supposed preserver of their
          flocks and herds, or to some particular animal, the real destroyer
          of them: each person then turns his face to the fire, breaks off a
          knob, and flinging it over his shoulders, says, <span class=

          called <span lang="gd" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=

          annually held here. It is chiefly celebrated by the cow-herds, who

          of boiled milk <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page153">[pg

          and eggs. These dishes they eat with a sort of cakes baked for the
          occasion, and having small lumps in the form of <em class=

          this last account no mention is made of bonfires, but they were
          probably lighted, for a contemporary writer informs us that in the
          parish of Kirkmichael, which adjoins the parish of Logierait on the
          east, the custom of lighting a fire in the fields and baking a
          consecrated cake on the first of May was not quite obsolete in his
          time.<a id="noteref_375" name="noteref_375" href=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">375</span></span></a> We
          may conjecture that the cake with knobs was formerly used for the
          purpose of determining who should be the <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Beltane carline”</span> or victim doomed to the
          flames. A trace of this custom survived, perhaps, in the custom of
          baking oatmeal cakes of a special kind and rolling them down hill
          about noon on the first of May; for it was thought that the person
          whose cake broke as it rolled would die or be unfortunate within
          the year. These cakes, or bannocks as we call them in Scotland,
          were baked in the usual way, but they were washed over with a thin
          batter composed of whipped egg, milk or cream, and a little
          oatmeal. This custom appears to have prevailed at or near Kingussie
          in Inverness-shire. At Achterneed, near Strathpeffer in Ross-shire,
          the Beltane bannocks were called <span lang="gd" class=

          because they were kneaded entirely in the hand, and not on a board
          or table like common cakes; and after being baked they might not be
          placed anywhere but in the hands of the children who were to eat
          them.<a id="noteref_376" name="noteref_376" href=

          and night the witches were abroad and busy casting spells on cattle
          and stealing cows' milk. To counteract their machinations, pieces
          of rowan-tree and woodbine, but especially of rowan-tree, were
          placed over the doors of the cow-houses, and fires were kindled by
          every farmer and cottar. Old thatch, straw, furze, or broom was
          piled in a heap and set on fire a little after sunset. While some
          of the bystanders kept tossing the blazing mass, others hoisted
          portions of it on pitchforks or poles and ran hither and thither,
          holding them as high as they could. Meantime the young people
          danced round the fire or ran through the smoke shouting,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Fire! blaze and burn the witches; fire!
          fire! burn the witches.”</span> In some districts a large round
          cake of oat or barley meal was rolled through the ashes. When all
          the fuel was consumed, the people scattered the ashes far and wide,
          and till the night grew quite dark they continued to run through
          them, crying, <span class="tei tei-q">“Fire! burn the

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In Wales also
          the custom of lighting Beltane fires at the beginning of May used
          to be observed, but the day on which they were kindled varied from
          the Eve of May Day to the third of May. The flame was sometimes
          elicited by the friction of two pieces of oak, as appears from the
          following description. <span class="tei tei-q">“The fire was done
          in this way. Nine men would turn their pockets inside out, and see
          that every piece of money and all metals were off their persons.
          Then the men went into the nearest woods, and collected sticks of
          nine different kinds of trees. These were carried to the spot where
          the fire had to be built. There a circle was cut in the sod, and
          the sticks were set crosswise. All around the circle the people
          stood and watched the proceedings. One of the men would then take
          two bits of oak, and rub them together until a flame was kindled.
          This was applied to the sticks, and soon a large fire was made.
          Sometimes two fires were set up side by side. These fires, whether
          one or two, were called <span lang="cy" class="tei tei-foreign"
          xml:lang="cy"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">coelcerth</span></span> or bonfire. Round
          cakes of oatmeal and brown meal were split in four, and placed in a
          small flour-bag, and everybody present had to pick out a portion.
          The last bit in the bag fell to the lot of the bag-holder. Each
          person who chanced to pick up a piece of brown-meal cake was
          compelled to leap three times over the flames, or to run thrice
          between the two fires, by which means the people thought they were
          sure of a plentiful harvest. Shouts and screams of those who had to
          face the ordeal could be heard ever so far, and those who chanced
          to pick the oatmeal portions sang and danced and clapped their
          hands in approval, as the holders of the brown bits leaped three
          times over the flames, or ran three times between the two fires. As
          a rule, no danger attended <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page156">[pg 156]</span><a name="Pg156" id="Pg156" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> these curious celebrations, but occasionally
          somebody's clothes caught fire, which was quickly put out. The
          greatest fire of the year was the eve of May, or May first, second,
          or third. The Midsummer Eve fire was more for the harvest. Very
          often a fire was built on the eve of November. The high ground near
          the Castle Ditches at Llantwit Major, in the Vale of Glamorgan, was
          a familiar spot for the Beltane on May third and on Midsummer
          Eve.... Sometimes the Beltane fire was lighted by the flames
          produced by stone instead of wood friction. Charred logs and
          faggots used in the May Beltane were carefully preserved, and from
          them the next fire was lighted. May fires were always started with
          old faggots of the previous year, and midsummer from those of the
          last summer. It was unlucky to build a midsummer fire from May
          faggots. People carried the ashes left after these fires to their
          homes, and a charred brand was not only effectual against
          pestilence, but magical in its use. A few of the ashes placed in a
          person's shoes protected the wearer from any great sorrow or
          woe.”</span><a id="noteref_380" name="noteref_380" href=

          with solemn ceremony in the king's house at Tara. In the year in
          which St. Patrick landed in Ireland it chanced that the night of
          the extinguished fires coincided with the Eve of Easter; and the
          saint, ignorant of this pagan superstition, resolved to celebrate
          his first Easter in Ireland after the true Christian fashion by
          lighting the holy Paschal fire on the hill of Slane, which rises
          high above the left bank of the Boyne, about twelve miles from the
          mouth of the river. So that night, looking from his palace at Tara
          across the darkened landscape, the king of Tara saw the solitary
          fire flaring on the top of the hill of Slane, and in consternation
          he asked his wise men what that light meant. They warned him of the
          danger that it betokened for the ancient faith of Erin.<a id=

          spite of the difference of date between Easter and Beltane, we may
          suspect that the new fire annually kindled with solemn ceremony
          about Easter in the king of Ireland's palace at Tara was no other
          than the Beltane fire. We have seen that in the Highlands of
          Scotland down to modern times it was customary to extinguish all

          <span class="tei tei-q">“and at it they were wont to exchange their
          goods and their wares and their jewels. At it, they were, also,
          wont to make a sacrifice to the Arch-God that they adored, whose
          name was Bèl (<span lang="ga" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
          "ga"><span style="font-style: italic">bayl</span></span>). It was,

          cattle that the district contained, between those two fires, as a
          preservative to guard them against all the diseases of that year.
          It is from that fire, thus made in honour of Bèl, that the day [the
          first of May] on which the noble feast of the apostles, Philip and

          custom of driving cattle through or between fires on May Day or the

          cattle-dealer of his acquaintance used to drive his cattle through
          fire on May Day so as to singe them a little, since he believed
          that it would preserve them from harm. When the Manxman was asked
          where the dealer came from, he answered, <span class=

          air on their hellish <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page160">[pg

          errands. On this witching night children in Voigtland also light
          bonfires on the heights and leap over them. Moreover, they wave
          burning brooms or toss them into the air. So far as the light of
          the bonfire reaches, so far will a blessing rest on the fields. The
          kindling of the fires on Walpurgis Night is called <span class=

          at which these fire-festivals have been mostly generally held all
          over Europe is the summer solstice, that is Midsummer Eve (the
          twenty-third of June) or Midsummer Day (the twenty-fourth of June).
          A faint tinge of Christianity has been given to them by naming
          Midsummer Day after St. John the Baptist, but we cannot doubt that
          the celebration dates from a time long before the beginning of our
          era. The summer solstice, or Midsummer Day, is the great
          turning-point in the sun's career, when, after climbing higher and
          higher day by day in the sky, the luminary stops and thenceforth
          retraces his steps down the heavenly road. Such a moment could not
          but be regarded with anxiety by primitive man so soon as he began
          to observe and ponder the courses of the great lights across the
          celestial vault; and having still to learn his own powerlessness in
          face of the vast cyclic changes of nature, he may have fancied that
          he could help the sun in his seeming decline—could prop his failing

          the sinking flame of the red lamp in his feeble hand. In some such
          thoughts as these the midsummer festivals of our European peasantry
          may perhaps have taken their rise. Whatever their origin, they have
          prevailed all over this quarter of the globe, from Ireland on the
          west to Russia on the east, and from Norway and Sweden on the north
          to Spain and Greece on the south.<a id="noteref_395" name=

          According to a mediæval writer, the three great features of the
          midsummer celebration were the bonfires, the procession with
          torches round the fields, and the custom of rolling a wheel. He
          tells us that boys burned bones and filth of various kinds to make
          a foul smoke, and that the smoke drove away certain noxious dragons
          which at this time, excited by the summer heat, copulated in the
          air and poisoned the wells and rivers by dropping their seed into
          them; and he explains the custom of trundling a wheel to mean that
          the sun, having now reached the highest point in the ecliptic,
          begins thenceforward to descend.<a id="noteref_396" name=

          first half of the sixteenth century informs us that in almost every
          village and town of Germany public bonfires were kindled on the Eve
          of St. John, and young and old, of both sexes, gathered about them
          and passed the time in dancing and singing. People on this occasion
          wore chaplets of mugwort and vervain, and they looked at the fire
          through bunches of larkspur which they held in their hands,
          believing that this would preserve their eyes in a healthy state
          throughout the year. As each departed, he threw the mugwort and
          vervain into the fire, saying, <span class="tei tei-q">“May all my
          ill-luck depart and be burnt up with these.”</span><a id=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">398</span></span></a> At
          Lower Konz, a village prettily situated on a hillside overlooking
          the Moselle, in the midst of a wood of walnut-trees and
          fruit-trees, the midsummer festival used to be celebrated as
          follows. A quantity of straw was collected on the top of the steep
          Stromberg Hill. Every inhabitant, or at least every householder,
          had to contribute his share of straw to the pile; a recusant was
          looked at askance, and if in the course of the year he happened to
          break a leg or lose a child, there was not a gossip in the village
          but knew the reason why. At nightfall the whole male population,
          men and boys, mustered on the top of the hill; the women and girls
          were not allowed to join them, but had to take up their position at
          a certain spring half-way down the slope. On the summit stood a
          huge wheel completely encased in some of the straw which had been
          jointly contributed by the villagers; the rest of the <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page164">[pg 164]</span><a name="Pg164" id="Pg164"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> straw was made into torches. From each
          side of the wheel the axle-tree projected about three feet, thus
          furnishing handles to the lads who were to guide it in its descent.
          The mayor of the neighbouring town of Sierck, who always received a
          basket of cherries for his services, gave the signal; a lighted
          torch was applied to the wheel, and as it burst into flame, two
          young fellows, strong-limbed and swift of foot, seized the handles
          and began running with it down the slope. A great shout went up.
          Every man and boy waved a blazing torch in the air, and took care
          to keep it alight so long as the wheel was trundling down the hill.
          Some of them followed the fiery wheel, and watched with amusement
          the shifts to which its guides were put in steering it round the
          hollows and over the broken ground on the mountainside. The great
          object of the young men who guided the wheel was to plunge it
          blazing into the water of the Moselle; but they rarely succeeded in
          their efforts, for the vineyards which cover the greater part of
          the declivity impeded their progress, and the wheel was often
          burned out before it reached the river. As it rolled past the women
          and girls at the spring, they raised cries of joy which were
          answered by the men on the top of the mountain; and the shouts were
          echoed by the inhabitants of neighbouring villages who watched the
          spectacle from their hills on the opposite bank of the Moselle. If
          the fiery wheel was successfully conveyed to the bank of the river
          and extinguished in the water, the people looked for an abundant
          vintage that year, and the inhabitants of Konz had the right to
          exact a waggon-load of white wine from the surrounding vineyards.
          On the other hand, they believed that, if they neglected to perform
          the ceremony, the cattle would be attacked by giddiness and
          convulsions and would dance in their stalls.<a id="noteref_399"

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Down at least to
          the middle of the nineteenth century the midsummer fires used to
          blaze all over Upper Bavaria. <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page165">[pg 165]</span><a name="Pg165" id="Pg165" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> They were kindled especially on the
          mountains, but also far and wide in the lowlands, and we are told
          that in the darkness and stillness of night the moving groups, lit
          up by the flickering glow of the flames, presented an impressive
          spectacle. In some places the people shewed their sense of the
          sanctity of the fires by using for fuel the trees past which the
          gay procession had defiled, with fluttering banners, on Corpus
          Christi Day. In others the children collected the firewood from
          door to door on the eve of the festival, singing their request for
          fuel at every house in doggerel verse. Cattle were driven through
          the fire to cure the sick animals and to guard such as were sound
          against plague and harm of every kind throughout the year. Many a
          householder on that day put out the fire on the domestic hearth and
          rekindled it by means of a brand taken from the midsummer bonfire.
          The people judged of the height to which the flax would grow in the
          year by the height to which the flames of the bonfire rose; and
          whoever leaped over the burning pile was sure not to suffer from
          backache in reaping the corn at harvest. But it was especially the
          practice for lovers to spring over the fire hand in hand, and the
          way in which each couple made the leap was the subject of many a
          jest and many a superstition. In one district the custom of
          kindling the bonfires was combined with that of lighting wooden
          discs and hurling them in the air after the manner which prevails
          at some of the spring festivals.<a id="noteref_400" name=

          others the old folk used to plant three charred sticks from the

          tall.<a id="noteref_402" name="noteref_402" href=

          Elsewhere an extinguished brand was put in the roof of the house to
          protect it against fire. In the towns about Würzburg the bonfires
          used to be kindled in the market-places, and the young people who
          jumped over them wore garlands of flowers, especially of mugwort
          and vervain, and carried sprigs of larkspur in their hands. They
          thought <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page166">[pg
          166]</span><a name="Pg166" id="Pg166" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          that such as looked at the fire holding a bit of larkspur before
          their face would be troubled by no malady of the eyes throughout
          the year.<a id="noteref_403" name="noteref_403" href=

          Further, it was customary at Würzburg, in the sixteenth century,
          for the bishop's followers to throw burning discs of wood into the
          air from a mountain which overhangs the town. The discs were
          discharged by means of flexible rods, and in their flight through
          the darkness presented the appearance of fiery dragons.<a id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the valley of
          the Lech, which divides Upper Bavaria from Swabia, the midsummer
          customs and beliefs are, or used to be, very similar. Bonfires are
          kindled on the mountains on Midsummer Day; and besides the bonfire
          a tall beam, thickly wrapt in straw and surmounted by a
          cross-piece, is burned in many places. Round this cross as it burns
          the lads dance with loud shouts; and when the flames have subsided,
          the young people leap over the fire in pairs, a young man and a
          young woman together. If they escape unsmirched, the man will not
          suffer from fever, and the girl will not become a mother within the
          year. Further, it is believed that the flax will grow that year as
          high as they leap over the fire; and that if a charred billet be
          taken from the fire and stuck in a flax-field it will promote the
          growth of the flax.<a id="noteref_405" name="noteref_405" href=
          "#note_405"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          Similarly in Swabia, lads and lasses, hand in hand, leap over the
          midsummer bonfire, praying that the hemp may grow three ells high,
          and they set fire to wheels of straw and send them rolling down the
          hill. Among the places where burning wheels were thus bowled down
          hill at Midsummer were the Hohenstaufen mountains in Wurtemberg and
          the Frauenberg near Gerhausen.<a id="noteref_406" name=

          href="#note_407"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">407</span></span></a> At
          Rottenburg in Swabia, down to the year 1807 or 1808, the festival
          was marked by some special features. About mid-day troops of boys
          went about the town begging for firewood at the houses. In each
          troop there were three leaders, one of whom carried a dagger, a
          second a paper banner, and a third a white plate covered with a
          white cloth. These three entered each house and recited verses, in
          which they expressed an intention of roasting Martin Luther and
          sending him to the devil; and for this meritorious service they
          expected to be paid, the contributions being received in the
          cloth-covered plate. In the evening they counted up their money and
          proceeded to <span class="tei tei-q">“behead the Angel-man.”</span>
          For this ceremony an open space was chosen, sometimes in the middle
          of the town. Here a stake was thrust into the ground and straw
          wrapt about it, so as to make a rude effigy of human form with
          arms, head, and face. Every boy brought a handful of nosegays and
          fastened them to the straw-man, who was thus enveloped in flowers.
          Fuel was heaped about the stake and set on fire. When the
          Angel-man, as the straw-effigy was called, blazed up, all the boys
          of the neighbourhood, who had gathered expectantly around, fell
          upon him with their wooden swords and hewed him to pieces. As soon
          as he had vanished in smoke and flame, the lads leaped backward and
          forward over the glowing embers, and later in the evening they
          feasted on the proceeds of their collection.<a id="noteref_408"
          name="noteref_408" href="#note_408"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">408</span></span></a> Here
          the Angel-man burnt in the fire appears to be identified with
          Martin Luther, to whom, as we have seen, allusion was made during
          the house-to-house visitation. The identification was probably
          modern, for we may assume that the custom of burning an effigy in
          the Midsummer bonfire is far older than the time of Luther.</p>

          children used to collect fuel from house to house for the Midsummer
          bonfire on St. John's Day; and lads and lasses leaped over the fire
          in couples. Here, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page168">[pg

          as elsewhere, a close connexion was traced between these bonfires
          and the harvest. In some places it was thought that those who
          leaped over the fires would not suffer from backache at reaping.
          Sometimes, as the young folk sprang over the flames, they cried,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Grow, that the hemp may be three ells
          high!”</span> This notion that the hemp or the corn would grow as
          high as the flames blazed or as the people jumped over them, seems
          to have been widespread in Baden. It was held that the parents of
          the young people who bounded highest over the fire would have the
          most abundant harvest; and on the other hand, if a man contributed
          nothing to the bonfire, it was imagined that there would be no
          blessing on his crops, and that his hemp in particular would never
          grow.<a id="noteref_409" name="noteref_409" href=

          the neighbourhood of Bühl and Achern the St. John's fires were
          kindled on the tops of hills; only the unmarried lads of the
          village brought the fuel, and only the unmarried young men and
          women sprang through the flames. But most of the villagers, old and
          young, gathered round the bonfires, leaving a clear space for the
          leapers to take their run. One of the bystanders would call out the
          names of a pair of sweethearts; on which the two would step out
          from the throng, take each other by the hand, and leap high and
          lightly through the swirling smoke and flames, while the spectators
          watched them critically and drew omens of their married life from
          the height to which each of them bounded. Such an invitation to
          jump together over the bonfire was regarded as tantamount to a
          public betrothal.<a id="noteref_410" name="noteref_410" href=

          Offenburg, in the Black Forest, on Midsummer Day the village boys
          used to collect faggots and straw on some steep and conspicuous
          height, and they spent some time in making circular wooden discs by
          slicing the trunk of a pine-tree across. When darkness had fallen,
          they kindled the bonfire, and then, as it blazed up, they lighted
          the discs at it, and, after swinging them to and fro at the end of
          a stout and supple hazel-wand, they hurled them one after the
          other, whizzing and flaming, into the air, where they described

          Speicher in the Eifel, a district which lies on the middle Rhine,
          to the west of Coblentz, a bonfire used to be kindled in front of
          the village on St. John's Day, and all the young people had to jump
          over it. Those who failed to do so were not allowed to join the
          rest in begging for eggs from house to house. Where no eggs were
          given, they drove a wedge into the keyhole of the door. On this day
          children in the Eifel used also to gather flowers in the fields,
          weave them into garlands, and throw the garlands on the roofs or
          hang them on the doors of the houses. So long as the flowers
          remained there, they were supposed to guard the house from fire and
          lightning.<a id="noteref_413" name="noteref_413" href=

          John's fires used to be commonly lighted down to about the middle
          of the nineteenth century, and the custom has probably not died
          out. At Edersleben, near Sangerhausen, a high pole was planted in
          the ground and a tar-barrel was hung from it by a chain which
          reached to the ground. The barrel was then set on fire and swung

          some old farm-houses of the Surenthal and Winenthal, in
          Switzerland, a couple of holes or a whole row of them may be seen
          facing each other in the door-posts of the barn or stable.
          Sometimes the holes are smooth and <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page170">[pg 170]</span><a name="Pg170" id="Pg170" class=

          blackened. The explanation of them is this. About midsummer, but
          especially on Midsummer Day, two such holes are bored opposite each
          other, into which the extremities of a strong pole are fixed. The
          holes are then stuffed with tow steeped in resin and oil; a rope is
          looped round the pole, and two young men, who must be brothers or
          must have the same baptismal name, and must be of the same age,
          pull the ends of the rope backwards and forwards so as to make the
          pole revolve rapidly, till smoke and sparks issue from the two
          holes in the door-posts. The sparks are caught and blown up with
          tinder, and this is the new and pure fire, the appearance of which
          is greeted with cries of joy. Heaps of combustible materials are
          now ignited with the new fire, and blazing bundles are placed on
          boards and sent floating down the brook. The boys light torches at
          the new fire and run to fumigate the pastures. This is believed to
          drive away all the demons and witches that molest the cattle.
          Finally the torches are thrown in a heap on the meadow and allowed
          to burn out. On their way back the boys strew the ashes over the
          fields, which is supposed to make them fertile. If a farmer has
          taken possession of a new house, or if servants have changed
          masters, the boys fumigate the new abode and are rewarded by the

          through the deepening gloom. While they are smouldering and sending

          brandishing the stumps, which emit showers of sparks, they chase
          one another or dance with the girls round the burning pile. Shots,
          too, are fired, and shouts raised. The fire, the smoke, the shots,
          and the shouts are all intended to scare away the witches, who are
          let loose on this witching day, and who would certainly work harm
          to the crops and the cattle, if they were not deterred by these
          salutary measures. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page171">[pg

          Mere contact with the fire brings all sorts of blessings. Hence
          when the bonfire is burning low, the lads leap over it, and the
          higher they bound, the better is the luck in store for them. He who
          surpasses his fellows is the hero of the day and is much admired by
          the village girls. It is also thought to be very good for the eyes
          to stare steadily at the bonfire without blinking; moreover he who
          does so will not drowse and fall asleep betimes in the long winter
          evenings. On Midsummer Eve the windows and doors of houses in
          Silesia are crowned with flowers, especially with the blue
          corn-flowers and the bright corn-cockles; in some villages long
          strings of garlands and nosegays are stretched across the streets.
          The people believe that on that night St. John comes down from
          heaven to bless the flowers and to keep all evil things from house
          and home.<a id="noteref_417" name="noteref_417" href=

          night. The fires are thought to be kindled in order to keep off the

          St. John (St. Hans) is the most joyous night of the whole year.
          Throughout some parts of the country, especially in the provinces
          of Bohus and Scania and in districts bordering on Norway, it is
          celebrated by the frequent discharge of firearms and by huge
          bonfires, formerly called Balder's Balefires (<span lang="sv"
          class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sv"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Balder's Bălar</span></span>), which are
          kindled at dusk on hills and eminences and throw a glare of light
          over the surrounding landscape. The people dance round the fires
          and leap over or through them. In parts of Norrland on St. John's
          Eve the bonfires are lit at the cross-roads. The fuel consists of
          nine different sorts of wood, and the spectators cast into the
          flames a kind of toad-stool (<span lang="sv" class=
          "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sv"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Bäran</span></span>) in order to counteract
          the power of the Trolls and other evil spirits, who are believed to
          be abroad that night; for at that mystic season the mountains open
          and from their cavernous depths the uncanny crew pours forth to
          dance and disport themselves for a time. The peasants believe that
          should any of the Trolls be in the vicinity they will shew
          themselves; and if an animal, for example a he or she goat, happens
          to be seen near the blazing, crackling pile, the peasants are
          firmly persuaded that it is no other than the Evil One in
          person.<a id="noteref_420" name="noteref_420" href=

          Further, it deserves to be remarked that in Sweden St. John's Eve
          is a festival of water as well as of fire; for certain holy springs
          are then supposed to be endowed with wonderful medicinal virtues,
          and many sick people resort to them for the healing of their

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">All over Bohemia
          bonfires still burn on Midsummer Eve. In the afternoon boys go
          about with handcarts from house to house collecting fuel, such as
          sticks, brushwood, old besoms, and so forth. They make their
          request at each house in rhyming verses, threatening with evil
          consequences the curmudgeons who refuse them a dole. Sometimes the
          young men fell a tall straight fir in the woods and set it up on a
          height, where the girls deck it with nosegays, wreaths of leaves,
          and red ribbons. Then brushwood is piled about it, and at nightfall
          the whole is set on fire. While the flames break out, the young men
          climb <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page174">[pg 174]</span><a name=
          "Pg174" id="Pg174" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the tree and fetch
          down the wreaths which the girls had placed on it. After that, lads
          and lasses stand on opposite sides of the fire and look at one
          another through the wreaths to see whether they will be true to
          each other and marry within the year. Also the girls throw the
          wreaths across the flames to the men, and woe to the awkward swain
          who fails to catch the wreath thrown him by his sweetheart. When
          the blaze has died down, each couple takes hands, and leaps thrice
          across the fire. He or she who does so will be free from ague
          throughout the year, and the flax will grow as high as the young
          folks leap. A girl who sees nine bonfires on Midsummer Eve will
          marry before the year is out. The singed wreaths are carried home
          and carefully preserved throughout the year. During thunderstorms a
          bit of the wreath is burned on the hearth with a prayer; some of it
          is given to kine that are sick or calving, and some of it serves to
          fumigate house and cattle-stall, that man and beast may keep hale
          and well. Sometimes an old cart-wheel is smeared with resin,
          ignited, and sent rolling down the hill. Often the boys collect all
          the worn-out besoms they can get hold of, dip them in pitch, and
          having set them on fire wave them about or throw them high into the
          air. Or they rush down the hillside in troops, brandishing the
          flaming brooms and shouting, only however to return to the bonfire
          on the summit when the brooms have burnt out. The stumps of the
          brooms and embers from the fire are preserved and stuck in cabbage
          gardens to protect the cabbages from caterpillars and gnats. Some
          people insert charred sticks and ashes from the bonfire in their
          sown fields and meadows, in their gardens and the roofs of their
          houses, as a talisman against lightning and foul weather; or they
          fancy that the ashes placed in the roof will prevent any fire from
          breaking out in the house. In some districts they crown or gird
          themselves with mugwort while the midsummer fire is burning, for
          this is supposed to be a protection against ghosts, witches, and
          sickness; in particular, a wreath of mugwort is a sure preventive
          of sore eyes. Sometimes the girls look at the bonfires through
          garlands of wild flowers, praying the fire to strengthen their eyes
          and eyelids. She who does this thrice will have no sore eyes

          driven over the places where the fires burned. Above all, the

          the young fellows who lit the bonfire going from house to house and
          receiving jugfuls of milk. And for the same reason they stick burs
          and mugwort on the gate or the hedge through which the cows go to

          Masuren, a district of Eastern Prussia inhabited by a branch of the
          Polish family, it is the custom on the evening of Midsummer Day to
          put out all the fires in the village. Then an oaken stake is driven
          into the ground and a wheel is fixed on it as on an axle. This
          wheel the villagers, working by relays, cause to revolve with great
          rapidity till fire is produced by friction. Every one takes home a

          who inhabit the Baltic provinces of Russia the most joyful festival
          of the year is held on Midsummer Day. The people drink and dance
          and sing and adorn themselves and their houses with flowers and
          branches. Chopped boughs of fir are strewn about the rooms, and
          leaves are stuck in the roofs. In every farm-yard a birch tree is
          set up, and every person of the name of John who enters the farm
          that day must break off a twig from the tree and hang up on its
          branches in return a small present for the family. When the serene
          twilight of the summer night has veiled the landscape, bonfires
          gleam on all the hills, and wild shouts of <span class=

          In Riga the day is a festival of flowers. From all the
          neighbourhood the peasants stream into the city laden with flowers
          and garlands. A market of flowers is held in an open square and on
          the chief bridge over the river; here wreaths of immortelles, which
          grow wild in the meadows and woods, are sold in great profusion and
          deck the houses <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page178">[pg

          their beauty, and masses of them adorn the flower-stalls. Till far

          flames the young men who are candidates for matrimony jump through
          the blaze. He who succeeds in leaping over the fire without
          singeing himself will be married within the year. At Vidovec in
          Croatia parties of two girls and one lad unite to kindle a
          Midsummer bonfire and to leap through the flames; he or she who
          leaps furthest will soonest wed. Afterwards lads and lasses dance
          in separate rings, but the ring of lads bumps up against the ring
          of girls and breaks it, and the girl who has to let go her
          neighbour's hand will forsake her true love hereafter.<a id=

          Magyars in Hungary the midsummer fire-festival is marked by the
          same features that meet us in so many parts of Europe. On Midsummer
          Eve in many <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page179">[pg

          places it is customary to kindle bonfires on heights and to leap
          over them, and from the manner in which the young people leap the
          bystanders predict whether they will marry soon. At Nograd-Ludany
          the young men and women, each carrying a truss of straw, repair to
          a meadow, where they pile the straw in seven or twelve heaps and
          set it on fire. Then they go round the fire singing, and hold a
          bunch of iron-wort in the smoke, while they say, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“No boil on my body, no sprain in my foot!”</span> This
          holding of the flowers over the flames is regarded, we are told, as
          equally important with the practice of walking through the fire
          barefoot and stamping it out. On this day also many Hungarian
          swineherds make fire by rotating a wheel round a wooden axle wrapt
          in hemp, and through the fire thus made they drive their pigs to
          preserve them from sickness.<a id="noteref_444" name="noteref_444"

          low down the slope, the lads on the height above set fire to little
          wooden wheels and, after swinging them to and fro at the end of a
          wand, send them whirling through the air to fall into the Danube.

          of Russia, who, like the Magyars, belong to the great Turanian
          family of mankind, also celebrate the summer solstice in the usual
          way. On the Eve of St. John all the people of a farm, a village, or
          an estate, walk solemnly in procession, the girls decked with
          flowers, the men with leaves and carrying bundles of straw under
          their arms. The lads carry lighted torches or flaming hoops steeped
          in tar at the top of long poles. Thus they go singing to the
          cattle-sheds, the granaries, and so forth, and afterwards march
          thrice round the dwelling-house. Finally, preceded by the shrill
          music of the bagpipes and shawms, they repair to a neighbouring
          hill, where the materials of a bonfire have <span class=

          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> been collected. Tar-barrels filled with
          combustibles are hung on poles, or the trunk of a felled tree has
          been set up with a great mass of juniper piled about it in the form
          of a pyramid. When a light has been set to the pile, old and young
          gather about it and pass the time merrily with song and music till
          break of day. Every one who comes brings fresh fuel for the fire,
          and they say, <span class="tei tei-q">“Now we all gather together,
          where St. John's fire burns. He who comes not to St. John's fire
          will have his barley full of thistles, and his oats full of
          weeds.”</span> Three logs are thrown into the fire with special
          ceremony; in throwing the first they say, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Gold of pleasure (a plant with yellow flowers) into
          the fire!”</span> in throwing the second they say, <span class=

          the third they cry, <span class="tei tei-q">“Flax on my

          shall be <span class="tei tei-q">“as pure as silver and as the

          the Esthonian island of Oesel, while they throw fuel into the
          midsummer fire, they call out, <span class="tei tei-q">“Weeds to
          the fire, flax to the field,”</span> or they fling three billets
          into the flames, saying, <span class="tei tei-q">“Flax grow
          long!”</span> And they take charred sticks from the bonfire home
          with them and keep them to make the cattle thrive. In some parts of
          the island the bonfire is formed by piling brushwood and other
          combustibles round a tree, at the top of which a flag flies.
          Whoever succeeds in knocking down the flag with a pole before it
          begins to burn will have good luck. Formerly the festivities lasted

          Farther east, in the valley of the Volga, the Cheremiss celebrate
          about midsummer a festival which Haxthausen regarded as identical
          with the midsummer ceremonies of the rest of Europe. A sacred tree
          in the forest, generally a tall and solitary oak, marks the scene
          of the solemnity. All the males assemble there, but no woman may be
          present. A heathen priest lights seven fires in a row from
          north-west to south-east; cattle are sacrificed and their blood
          poured in the fires, each of which is dedicated to a separate
          deity. Afterwards the holy tree is illumined by lighted candles
          placed on its branches; the people fall on their knees and with
          faces bowed to the earth pray that God would be pleased to bless
          them, their children, their cattle, and their bees, grant them

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When we pass
          from the east to the west of Europe we still find the summer
          solstice celebrated with rites of the same general character. Down
          to about the middle of the nineteenth century the custom of
          lighting bonfires at midsummer prevailed so commonly in France that
          there was hardly a town or a village, we are told, where they were
          not kindled.<a id="noteref_451" name="noteref_451" href=

          Though the pagan origin of the custom may be regarded as certain,
          the Catholic Church threw a Christian cloak over it by boldly
          declaring that the bonfires were lit in token of the general
          rejoicing at the birth of the Baptist, who opportunely came into
          the world at the solstice of summer, just as his greater successor
          did at the solstice of winter; so that the whole year might be said
          to revolve on <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page182">[pg

          Writing in the seventeenth century Bishop Bossuet expressly affirms
          this edifying theory of the Midsummer bonfires, and he tells his
          catechumens that the Church herself participated in the
          illumination, since in several dioceses, including his own diocese
          of Meaux, a number of parishes kindled what were called
          ecclesiastical fires for the purpose of banishing the superstitions
          practised at the purely mundane bonfires. These superstitions, he
          goes on to say, consisted in dancing round the fire, playing,

          gathering herbs at noon or while fasting, carrying them on the

          However excellent the intentions of the ecclesiastical authorities
          may have been, they failed of effecting their purpose; for the
          superstitions as well as the bonfires survived in France far into
          the nineteenth century, if indeed they are extinct even now at the
          beginning of the twentieth. Writing in the latter part of the
          nineteenth century Mr. Ch. Cuissard tells us that he himself
          witnessed in Touraine and Poitou the superstitious practices which
          he describes as follows: <span class="tei tei-q">“The most
          credulous examine the ways in which the flame burns and draw good
          or bad omens accordingly. Others, after leaping through the flames
          crosswise, pass their little children through them thrice, fully
          persuaded that the little ones will then be able to walk at once.
          In some places the shepherds make their sheep tread the embers of
          the extinct fire in order to preserve them from the foot-rot. Here
          you may see about midnight an old woman grubbing among the cinders
          of the pyre to find the hair of the Holy Virgin or Saint
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page183">[pg 183]</span><a name=
          "Pg183" id="Pg183" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> John, which she
          deems an infallible specific against fever. There, another woman is
          busy plucking the roots of the herbs which have been burned on the
          surface of the ground; she intends to eat them, imagining that they
          are an infallible preservative against cancer. Elsewhere a girl
          wears on her neck a flower which the touch of St. John's fire has
          turned for her into a talisman, and she is sure to marry within the
          year. Shots are fired at the tree planted in the midst of the fire
          to drive away the demons who might purpose to send sicknesses about
          the country. Seats are set round about the bonfire, in order that
          the souls of dead relations may come and enjoy themselves for a
          little with the living.”</span><a id="noteref_454" name=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In Brittany,
          apparently, the custom of the Midsummer bonfires is kept up to this
          day. Thus in Lower Brittany every town and every village still
          lights its <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

          Night. When the flames have died down, the whole assembly kneels
          round about the bonfire and an old man prays aloud. Then they all
          rise and march thrice round the fire; at the third turn they stop
          and every one picks up a pebble and throws it on the burning pile.
          After that they disperse.<a id="noteref_455" name="noteref_455"

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">455</span></span></a> In
          Finistère the bonfires of St. John's Day are kindled by preference
          in an open space near a chapel of St. John; but if there is no such
          chapel, they are lighted in the square facing the parish church and
          in some districts at cross-roads. Everybody brings fuel for the
          fire, it may be a faggot, a log, a branch, or an armful of gorse.
          When the vespers are over, the parish priest sets a light to the
          pile. All heads are bared, prayers recited, and hymns sung. Then
          the dancing begins. The young folk skip round the blazing pile and
          leap over it, when the flames have died down. If anybody makes a
          false step and falls or rolls in the hot embers, he or she is
          greeted with hoots and retires abashed from the circle of dancers.
          Brands are carried home from the bonfire to protect the houses
          against lightning, conflagrations, and certain maladies and spells.
          The precious talisman is carefully kept in a cupboard till

          Quimper, and in the district of Léon, chairs used to be placed

          Brest on this day thousands of people used to assemble on the
          ramparts towards evening and brandish lighted torches, which they
          swung in circles or flung by hundreds into the air. The closing of
          the town gates put an end to the spectacle, and the lights might be
          seen dispersing in all directions like wandering
          will-o'-the-wisps.<a id="noteref_458" name="noteref_458" href=

          Upper Brittany the materials for the midsummer bonfires, which
          generally consist of bundles of furze and heath, are furnished by
          voluntary contributions, and piled on the tops of hills round
          poles, each of which is surmounted by a nosegay or a crown. This
          nosegay or crown is generally provided by a man named John or a
          woman named Jean, and it is always a John or a Jean who puts a
          light to the bonfire. While the fire is blazing the people dance
          and sing round it, and when the flames have subsided they leap over
          the glowing embers. Charred sticks from the bonfire are thrown into
          wells to improve the water, and they are also taken home as a
          protection against thunder.<a id="noteref_459" name="noteref_459"
          href="#note_459"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">459</span></span></a> To
          make them thoroughly effective, however, against thunder and
          lightning you should keep them near your bed, between a bit of a
          Twelfth Night cake and a sprig of boxwood which has been blessed on
          Palm Sunday.<a id="noteref_460" name="noteref_460" href=

          Flowers from the nosegay or crown which overhung the fire are
          accounted charms against disease and pain, both bodily and
          spiritual; hence girls hang them at their breast by a thread of
          scarlet wool. In many parishes of Brittany the priest used to go in
          procession with the crucifix and kindle the bonfire with his own
          hands; <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page185">[pg

          and farmers were wont to drive their flocks and herds through the
          fire in order to preserve them from sickness till midsummer of the
          following year. Also it was believed that every girl who danced
          round nine of the bonfires would marry within the year.<a id=

          midsummer fires have now almost disappeared, at least in the
          district known as the Bocage, but they used to shine on every hill.
          They were commonly made by piling brushwood, broom, and ferns about
          a tall tree, which was decorated with a crown of moss and sometimes
          with flowers. While they burned, people danced and sang round them,
          and young folk leaped over the flames or the glowing ashes. In the
          valley of the Orne the custom was to kindle the bonfire just at the
          moment when the sun was about to dip below the horizon; and the
          peasants drove their cattle through the fires to protect them
          against witchcraft, especially against the spells of witches and
          wizards who attempted to steal the milk and butter.<a id=

          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">462</span></span></a> At
          Jumièges in Normandy, down to the first half of the nineteenth
          century, the midsummer festival was marked by certain singular
          features which bore the stamp of a very high antiquity. Every year,
          on the twenty-third of June, the Eve of St. John, the Brotherhood
          of the Green Wolf chose a new chief or master, who had always to be
          taken from the hamlet of Conihout. On being elected, the new head
          of the brotherhood assumed the title of the Green Wolf, and donned
          a peculiar costume consisting of a long green mantle and a very
          tall green hat of a conical shape and without a brim. Thus arrayed
          he stalked solemnly at the head of the brothers, chanting the hymn
          of St. John, the crucifix and holy banner leading the way, to a
          place called Chouquet. Here the procession was met by the priest,
          precentors, and choir, who conducted the brotherhood to the parish
          church. After hearing mass the company adjourned to the house of
          the Green Wolf, where a simple repast, such as is required by the
          church on fast-days, was served up to them. Then they <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page186">[pg 186]</span><a name="Pg186" id="Pg186"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> danced before the door till it was time
          to light the bonfire. Night being come, the fire was kindled to the
          sound of hand-bells by a young man and a young woman, both decked
          with flowers. As the flames rose, the <span lang="la" class=
          "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Te
          Deum</span></span> was sung, and a villager thundered out a parody
          in the Norman dialect of the hymn <span lang="la" class=
          "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ut
          queant laxis</span></span>. Meantime the Green Wolf and his
          brothers, with their hoods down on their shoulders and holding each
          other by the hand, ran round the fire after the man who had been
          chosen to be the Green Wolf of the following year. Though only the
          first and the last man of the chain had a hand free, their business
          was to surround and seize thrice the future Green Wolf, who in his
          efforts to escape belaboured the brothers with a long wand which he
          carried. When at last they succeeded in catching him they carried
          him to the burning pile and made as if they would throw him on it.
          This ceremony over, they returned to the house of the Green Wolf,
          where a supper, still of the most meagre fare, was set before them.
          Up till midnight a sort of religious solemnity prevailed. No
          unbecoming word might fall from the lips of any of the company, and
          a censor, armed with a hand-bell, was appointed to mark and punish
          instantly any infraction of the rule. But at the stroke of twelve
          all this was changed. Constraint gave way to license; pious hymns
          were replaced by Bacchanalian ditties, and the shrill quavering
          notes of the village fiddle hardly rose above the roar of voices
          that went up from the merry brotherhood of the Green Wolf. Next
          day, the twenty-fourth of June or Midsummer Day, was celebrated by
          the same personages with the same noisy gaiety. One of the
          ceremonies consisted in parading, to the sound of musketry, an
          enormous loaf of consecrated bread, which, rising in tiers, was
          surmounted by a pyramid of verdure adorned with ribbons. After that
          the holy hand-bells, deposited on the step of the altar, were
          entrusted as insignia of office to the man who was to be the Green
          Wolf next year.<a id="noteref_463" name="noteref_463" href=

          Breteuil in Picardy (department of Oise) the priest used to kindle
          the midsummer bonfire, and the people marched thrice round it in
          procession. Some of them took ashes of the fire home with them to

          custom is, or was down to recent years, similar at Vorges, near
          Laon. An enormous pyre, some fifty or sixty feet high, supported in
          the middle by a tall pole, is constructed every year on the
          twenty-third of June, the Eve of St. John. It stands at one end of
          the village, and all the inhabitants contribute fuel to it: a cart
          goes round the village in the morning, by order of the mayor,
          collecting combustibles from house to house: no one would dream of
          refusing to comply with the customary obligation. In the evening,
          after a service in honour of St. John has been performed in the
          church, the clergy, the mayor, the municipal authorities, the rural
          police, and the fire-brigade march in procession to the bonfire,
          accompanied by the inhabitants and a crowd of idlers drawn by
          curiosity from the neighbouring villages. After addressing the
          throng in a sermon, to which they pay little heed, the parish
          priest sprinkles the pyre with holy water, and taking a lighted
          torch from the hand of an assistant sets fire to the pile. The
          enormous blaze, flaring up against the dark sky of the summer
          night, is seen for many miles around, particularly from the hill of
          Laon. When it has died down into a huge heap of glowing embers and
          grey ashes, every one carries home a charred stick or some cinders;
          and the fire-brigade, playing their hose on what remains,
          extinguishes the smouldering fire. The people preserve the charred
          sticks and cinders throughout the year, believing that these relics
          of St. John's bonfire have power to guard them from lightning and
          from contagious diseases.<a id="noteref_465" name="noteref_465"

          <span class="tei tei-q">“fires of St. John.”</span> The site of the
          bonfire was either the village square or beside the cross in the
          cemetery. Here a great pile of faggots, brushwood, and grass was
          accumulated about a huge branch, which bore at the top a crown of
          fresh flowers. The priest blessed the bonfire and the people danced
          round it. When it blazed and crackled, the bystanders thrust their
          heads into the puffs of smoke, in the belief that it would preserve
          them from a multitude of ills; and when the fire was burnt out,
          they rushed upon the charred embers and ashes and carried them
          home, imagining that they had a secret virtue to guard their houses
          from being struck by lightning or consumed by fire. Some of the
          Perche farmers in the old days, not content with the public
          bonfire, used to light little private bonfires in their farmyards
          and make all their cattle pass through the smoke and flames for the

          generally lit on high ground and the young folks of both sexes sang

          Bresse bonfires used to be kindled on Midsummer Eve (the
          twenty-third of June) and the people danced about them in a circle.
          Devout persons, particularly old women, circumambulated the fires
          fourteen times, telling their beads and mumbling seven <span lang=

          to its means contributed faggots, which were piled round a pole on
          the highest ground in the neighbourhood. In the hamlets the office
          of kindling the fire devolved on the oldest man, but in the towns
          it was the priest or the mayor who discharged the duty. Here, as in
          Brittany, people supposed that a girl who had danced round nine of
          the midsummer bonfires would marry within the year. To leap several
          times over the fire was regarded as a sort of purification which
          kept off sickness and brought good luck to the leaper. Hence the
          nimble youth bounded through the smoke and flames, and when the
          fire had somewhat abated parents jumped across it with their
          children in their arms in order that the little ones might also
          partake of its beneficent <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page190">[pg

          influence. Embers from the extinct bonfire were taken home, and
          after being dipped in holy water were kept as a talisman against
          all kinds of misfortune, but especially against lightning.<a id=

          same virtue was ascribed to the ashes and charred sticks of the
          midsummer bonfire in Périgord, where everybody contributed his
          share of fuel to the pile and the whole was crowned with flowers,
          especially with roses and lilies.<a id="noteref_475" name=

          the borders of the departments of Creuse and Corrèze, in Central
          France, the fires of St. John used to be lit on the Eve of the
          saint's day (the twenty-third of June); the custom seems to have
          survived till towards the end of the nineteenth century. Men,
          women, and children assembled round the fires, and the young people
          jumped over them. Children were brought by their parents or elder
          brothers into contact with the flames in the belief that this would
          save them from fever. Older people girded themselves with stalks of
          rye taken from a neighbouring field, because they fancied that by
          so doing they would not grow weary in reaping the corn at
          harvest.<a id="noteref_476" name="noteref_476" href=

          to protect the cattle from sickness and sorcery. When the fire died
          down people took some of the ashes home with them, either to keep
          them in the house as a preservative against thunder or to scatter
          them on the fields for the purpose of destroying corn-cockles and
          darnel. Stones were also placed round the fire, and it was believed
          that the first to lift one of these stones next morning would find

          it is still usual, or was so down to recent years, in Poitou to
          kindle fires on this day at cross-roads or on the heights. The
          oldest or youngest person present sets a light to the pile, which
          consists of broom, gorse, and heath. A bright and crackling blaze
          shoots up, but soon dies down, and over it the young folk leap.
          They also throw stones into it, picking the stone according to the
          size of the turnips that they wish to have that year. It is said
          that <span class="tei tei-q">“the good Virgin”</span> comes and
          sits on the prettiest of the stones, and next morning they see
          there her beautiful golden tresses. At Lussac, in Poitou, the
          lighting of the midsummer bonfire is still an affair of some
          ceremony. A pyramid of faggots is piled round a tree or tall pole
          on the ground where the fair is held; the priest goes in procession
          to the spot and kindles the pile. When prayers have been said and
          the clergy have withdrawn, the people continue to march round the
          fire, telling their beads, but it is not till the flames have begun
          to die down that the youth jump over them. A brand from the
          midsummer bonfire is supposed to be a preservative against
          thunder.<a id="noteref_480" name="noteref_480" href=

          Western France now mostly comprised in the department of Charente
          Inférieure, the fires of St. John are still kindled on Midsummer
          Eve, but the custom is neither so common nor carried out with so
          much pomp and ceremony as formerly. Great quantities of wood used
          to be piled on an open space round about a huge post or a tree
          stripped of its leaves and branches. Every one took care to
          contribute a faggot to the pile, and the whole population marched
          to the spot in procession with the crucifix at their head and the
          priest bringing up the rear. The squire, or other person of high
          degree, put the torch to the pyre, and the priest blessed it. In
          the southern and eastern parts of Saintonge children and cattle
          were passed through the smoke of the bonfires to preserve them from
          contagious diseases, and when the fire had gone out the people
          scuffled for the charred fragments of the great post, which they
          regarded as talismans against thunder. Next morning, on Midsummer
          Day, every shepherdess in the neighbourhood was up very early, for
          the first to drive her sheep over the blackened cinders and ashes
          of the great bonfire was sure to have the best flock all that year.
          Where the shepherds shrunk from driving their flocks through the
          smoke and flames of the bonfire they contented themselves with
          marking the hinder-quarters of the animals with a broom which had
          been blackened in the ashes.<a id="noteref_483" name="noteref_483"

          is fastened to the top of the tree, and at the moment when the fire

          man or a child kindles the fire which is to consume tree and
          garlands together. While the blaze lasts the people sing and dance;

          consequences. At Marseilles they drench each other with scented

          door to door begging for fuel, and they are seldom sent empty away.
          Formerly the priest, the mayor, and the aldermen used to walk in
          procession to the bonfire, and even deigned to light it; after
          which the assembly marched thrice round the burning pile, while the

          and rockets fizzed and sputtered in the air. Dancing began later,
          and the bystanders threw water on each other. At Ciotat, while the
          fire was blazing, the young people plunged into the sea and
          splashed each other vigorously. At Vitrolles they bathed in a pond
          in order that they might not suffer from fever during the year, and
          at Saintes-Maries they watered the horses to protect them from the

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In Belgium the
          custom of kindling the midsummer bonfires has long disappeared from
          the great cities, but it is still kept up in rural districts and
          small towns of Brabant, Flanders, and Limburg. People leap across
          the fires to protect themselves against fever, and in eastern
          Flanders women perform similar leaps for the purpose of ensuring an
          easy delivery. At Termonde young people go from door to door
          collecting fuel for the fires and reciting verses, in which they
          beg the inmates to give them <span class="tei tei-q">“wood of St.
          John”</span> and to keep some wood for St. Peter's Day (the
          twenty-ninth of June); for in Belgium the Eve of St. Peter's Day is
          celebrated by bonfires and dances exactly like those which
          commemorate St. John's Eve. The ashes of <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page195">[pg 195]</span><a name="Pg195" id="Pg195" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> the St. John's fires are deemed by Belgian
          peasants an excellent remedy for consumption, if you take a
          spoonful or two of them, moistened with water, day by day. People
          also burn vervain in the fires, and they say that in the ashes of
          the plant you may find, if you look for it, the <span class=

          many parts of Brabant St. Peter's bonfire used to be much larger
          than that of his rival St. John. When it had burned out, both sexes
          engaged in a game of ball, and the winner became the King of Summer
          or of the Ball and had the right to choose his Queen. Sometimes the
          winner was a woman, and it was then her privilege to select her
          royal mate. This pastime was well known at Louvain and it continued
          to be practised at Grammont and Mespelaer down to the second half
          of the nineteenth century. At Mespelaer, which is a village near
          Termonde, a huge pile of eglantine, reeds, and straw was collected
          in a marshy meadow for the bonfire; and next evening after vespers
          the young folk who had lit it assembled at the <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Good Life”</span> tavern to play the game. The winner
          was crowned with a wreath of roses, and the rest danced and sang in
          a ring about him. At Grammont, while the bonfire was lit and the
          dances round it took place on St. Peter's Eve, the festival of the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Crown of Roses”</span> was deferred till
          the following Sunday. The young folk arranged among themselves
          beforehand who should be King and Queen of the Roses: the rosy
          wreaths were hung on cords across the street: the dancers danced
          below them, and at a given moment the wreaths fell on the heads of
          the chosen King and Queen, who had to entertain their fellows at a
          feast. According to some people the fires of St. Peter, like those
          of St. John, were lighted in order to drive away dragons.<a id=

          together, and make merry by the side of a large fire made in the
          middle of the street, or in some open and convenient place, over
          which the young men frequently leaped by way of frolic, and also
          exercised themselves with various sports and pastimes, more

          the streets of London the midsummer fires were lighted in the time
          of Queen Elizabeth down to the end of the sixteenth century, as we
          learn from Stow's description, which runs thus: <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“In the months of June and July, on the vigils of
          festival days, and on the same festival days in the evenings after
          the sun setting, there were usually made bonfires in the streets,
          every man bestowing wood or labour towards them; the wealthier sort
          also, before their doors near to the said bonfires, would set out
          tables on the vigils furnished with sweet bread and good drink, and
          on the festival days with meats and drinks plentifully, whereunto
          they would invite their neighbours and passengers also to sit and
          be merry with them in great familiarity, praising God for His
          benefits bestowed on them. These were called bonfires as well of
          good amity amongst neighbours that being before at controversy,
          were there, by the labour of others, reconciled, and made of bitter
          enemies loving friends; and also for the virtue that a great fire
          hath to purge the infection of the air. On the vigil of St. John
          the Baptist, and on St. Peter and Paul the Apostles, every man's
          door being shadowed with green birch, long fennel, St. John's wort,
          orpin, white lilies, and such like, garnished upon with garlands of
          beautiful flowers, had also lamps of glass, with oil burning in
          them all the night; some hung <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          the sixteenth century the Eton boys used to kindle a bonfire on the

          Day.<a id="noteref_497" name="noteref_497" href=

          Writing in the second half of the seventeenth century, the
          antiquary John Aubrey tells us that bonfires were still kindled in
          many places on St. John's Night, but that the civil wars had thrown
          many of these old customs out of fashion. Wars, he adds, extinguish
          superstition as well as religion and laws, and there is nothing
          like gunpowder for putting phantoms to flight.<a id="noteref_498"

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the north of
          England these fires used to be lit in the open streets. Young and
          old gathered round them, and while the young leaped over the fires
          and engaged in games, their elders looked on and probably
          remembered with regret the days when they used to foot it as
          nimbly. Sometimes the fires were kindled on the tops of high hills.
          The people also carried firebrands about the fields.<a id=

          Northumberland the custom seems to have lasted into the first

          Sandhill bonfires were kindled on the Eve of St. Peter as well as
          on Midsummer Eve; the custom is attested for the year 1575, when it
          was described as ancient.<a id="noteref_503" name="noteref_503"

          are told that <span class="tei tei-q">“on Midsummer's eve, reckoned
          according to the old style, it was formerly the custom of the
          inhabitants, young and old, not only of Whalton, but of most of the
          adjacent villages, to collect a large cartload of whins and other
          combustible materials, which was dragged by them with great
          rejoicing (a fiddler being seated on the top of the cart) into the
          village and erected into a pile. The people from the surrounding
          country assembled towards evening, when it was set on fire; and
          whilst the young danced around it, the elders looked on smoking
          their pipes and drinking their beer, until it was consumed. There
          can be little doubt that this curious old custom dates from a very
          remote antiquity.”</span> In a law-suit, which was tried in 1878,
          the rector of Whalton gave evidence of the constant use of the
          village green for the ceremony since 1843. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“The bonfire,”</span> he said, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“was lighted a little to the north-east of the well at
          Whalton, and partly on the footpath, and people danced round it and
          jumped through it. That was never interrupted.”</span> The Rev. G.
          R. Hall, writing in 1879, says that <span class="tei tei-q">“the
          fire festivals or bonfires of the summer solstice at the Old
          Midsummer until recently were commemorated on Christenburg Crags

          parishes in great numbers to make excursions on the water. St.

          eves a line of tar-barrels, relieved occasionally by large
          bonfires, is seen in the centre of each of the principal streets in
          Penzance. On either side of this line young men and women pass up
          and down, swinging round their heads heavy torches made of large
          pieces of folded canvas steeped in tar, and nailed to the ends of
          sticks between three and four feet long; the flames of some of
          these almost equal those of the tar-barrels. Rows of lighted
          candles, also, when the air is calm, are fixed outside the windows
          or along the sides of the streets. In St. Just, and other mining
          parishes, the young miners, mimicking their fathers' employments,
          bore rows of holes in the rocks, load them with gunpowder, and
          explode them in rapid succession by trains of the same substance.
          As the holes are not deep enough to split the rocks, the same
          little batteries serve for many years. On these nights, Mount's Bay

          or a village existed, was lighted up with these stationary or
          moving fires. In the early part of the evening, children may be
          seen wearing wreaths of flowers—a custom in all probability
          originating from the ancient use of these ornaments when they
          danced around the fires. At the close of the fireworks in Penzance,
          a great number of persons of both sexes, chiefly from the
          neighbourhood of the quay, used always, until within the last few
          years, to join hand in hand, forming a long string, and run through
          the streets, playing <span class="tei tei-q">‘thread the
          needle,’</span> heedless of the fireworks showered upon them, and
          oftentimes leaping over the yet glowing embers. I have on these
          occasions seen boys following one another, jumping through flames
          higher than themselves.”</span><a id="noteref_511" name=

          different kinds of wood and charred faggots carefully preserved
          from the last midsummer were deemed necessary to build the bonfire,
          which was generally done on rising ground. Various herbs were
          thrown into the blaze; and girls with bunches of three or nine
          different kinds of flowers would take the hands of boys, who wore
          flowers in their buttonholes and hats, and together the young
          couples would leap over the fires. On the same two midsummer days
          roses and wreaths of flowers were hung over the doors and windows.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Describing a midsummer fire, an old
          inhabitant, born in 1809, remembered being taken to different hills
          in the Vale of Glamorgan to see festivities in which people from
          all parts of the district participated. She was at that time about
          fourteen, and old enough to retain a vivid recollection of the
          circumstances. People conveyed trusses of straw to the top of the
          hill, where men and youths waited for the contributions. Women and
          girls were stationed at the bottom of the hill. Then a large
          cart-wheel was thickly swathed with straw, and not an inch of wood
          was left in sight. A pole was inserted through the centre of the
          wheel, so that long ends extended about a yard on each side. If any
          straw remained, it was made up into torches at the top of tall
          sticks. At a given signal the wheel was lighted, and sent rolling
          downhill. If this fire-wheel went out before it reached the bottom
          of the hill, a very poor harvest was promised. If it kept lighted
          all the way down, and continued blazing for a long time, the
          harvest would be exceptionally abundant. Loud cheers and shouts
          accompanied the progress of the wheel.”</span><a id="noteref_512"

          honour of the sun. Accordingly, exactly at midnight, the fires
          began to appear; and taking the advantage of going up to the leads
          of the house, which had a widely extended view, I saw on a radius
          of thirty miles, all around, the fires burning on every eminence
          which the country afforded. I had a farther satisfaction in
          learning, from undoubted authority, that the people danced round
          the fires, and at the close went through these fires, and made
          their sons and daughters, together with their cattle, pass through
          the fire; and the whole was conducted with religious

          in honour of St. John. On Sunday night bonfires were observed
          throughout nearly every county in the province of Leinster. In
          Kilkenny, fires blazed on every hillside at intervals of about a
          mile. There were very many in the Queen's County, also in Kildare
          and Wexford. The effect in the rich sunset appeared to travellers
          very grand. The people assemble, and dance round the fires, the
          children jump through the flames, and in former times live coals
          were carried into the corn-fields to prevent blight.”</span><a id=

          through it, and several children were thrown across the sparkling
          embers; while a wooden frame, of some eight feet long, with a
          horse's head fixed to one end, and a large white sheet thrown over
          it concealing the wood and the man on whose head it was carried,
          made its appearance. This was greeted with loud shouts of

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Lady Wilde's
          account of the midsummer festival in Ireland is picturesque and
          probably correct in substance, although she does not cite her
          authorities. As it contains some interesting features which are not
          noticed by the other writers on Ireland whom I have consulted, I
          will quote the greater part of it in full. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“In ancient times,”</span> she says, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“the sacred fire was lighted with great ceremony on
          Midsummer Eve; and on that night all the people of the adjacent
          country kept fixed watch on the western promontory of Howth, and
          the moment the first flash was seen from that spot the fact of
          ignition was announced with wild cries and cheers repeated from
          village to village, when all the local fires began to blaze, and
          Ireland was circled by a cordon of flame rising up from every hill.
          Then the dance and song began round every fire, and the wild
          hurrahs filled the air with the most frantic revelry. Many of these
          ancient customs are still continued, and the fires are still
          lighted on St. John's Eve on every hill in Ireland. When the fire
          has burned down to a red glow the young men strip to the waist and
          leap over or through the flames; this is done backwards and
          forwards several times, and he who braves the greatest blaze is
          considered the victor over the powers of evil, and is greeted with
          tremendous applause. When the fire burns still lower, the young
          girls leap the flame, and those who leap clean over three times
          back and forward will be certain of a speedy marriage and good luck
          in after-life, with many children. The married women then walk
          through the lines of the burning embers; and when the fire is
          nearly burnt and trampled down, the yearling cattle are driven
          through the hot ashes, and their back is singed with a lighted
          hazel twig. These rods are kept safely afterwards, being considered
          of immense power to drive the cattle to and from the watering
          places. As the fire diminishes the shouting grows fainter, and the
          song and the dance commence; while professional <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page205">[pg 205]</span><a name="Pg205" id="Pg205"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> story-tellers narrate tales of
          fairy-land, or of the good old times long ago, when the kings and
          princes of Ireland dwelt amongst their own people, and there was
          food to eat and wine to drink for all comers to the feast at the
          king's house. When the crowd at length separate, every one carries
          home a brand from the fire, and great virtue is attached to the
          lighted <span lang="ga" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=

          safely carried to the house without breaking or falling to the
          ground. Many contests also arise amongst the young men; for whoever
          enters his house first with the sacred fire brings the good luck of
          the year with him.”</span><a id="noteref_524" name="noteref_524"

          mystical virtue at midsummer. <span class="tei tei-q">“At Stoole,
          near Downpatrick, there is a ceremony commencing at twelve o'clock
          at night on Midsummer Eve. Its sacred mount is consecrated to St.
          Patrick; the plain contains three wells, to which the most
          extraordinary virtues are attributed. Here and there are heaps of
          stones, around some of which appear great numbers of people,
          running with as much speed as possible; around others crowds of
          worshippers kneel with bare legs and feet as an indispensable part
          of the penance. The men, without coats, with handkerchiefs on their
          heads instead of hats, having gone seven times round each heap,
          kiss the ground, cross themselves, and proceed to the hill; here
          they ascend, on their bare knees, by a path so steep and rugged
          that it would be difficult to walk up. Many hold their hands
          clasped at the back of their necks, and several carry large stones
          on their heads. Having repeated this ceremony seven times, they go
          to what is called St. Patrick's Chair, which are two great flat
          stones fixed upright in the hill; here they cross and bless
          themselves as they step in between these stones, and, while
          repeating prayers, an old man, seated for the purpose, turns them
          round on their feet three times, for which he is paid; the devotee
          then goes to conclude his penance at a pile of stones, named the
          Altar. While this busy scene is continued by the multitude, the
          wells and streams issuing from them are thronged by crowds of halt,
          maimed, and blind, pressing <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          consecrated by their patron saint, and so powerful is the
          impression of its efficacy on their minds, that many of those who
          go to be healed, and who are not totally blind, or altogether

          had a tendency to purify their herds and flocks, and to prevent

          the herdsmen of the country round about annually kindle a bonfire
          at sunset on Midsummer Day (the twenty-fourth of June); the men or
          lads collect the fuel and push each other through the smoke and
          flames. The custom is kept up through the benefaction of a certain
          Alexander Hogg, a native of the parish, who died about 1790 and
          left a small sum for the maintenance of a midsummer bonfire on the
          spot, because as <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page207">[pg

          the village of Tarbolton in Ayrshire a bonfire has been annually
          kindled from time immemorial on the evening of the first Monday
          after the eleventh of June. A noted cattle-market was formerly held
          at the fair on the following day. The bonfire is still lit at the
          gloaming by the lads and lasses of the village on a high mound or
          hillock just outside of the village. Fuel for it is collected by
          the lads from door to door. The youth dance round the fire and leap
          over the fringes of it. The many cattle-drovers who used to
          assemble for the fair were wont to gather round the blazing pile,
          smoke their pipes, and listen to the young folk singing in chorus
          on the hillock. Afterwards they wrapped themselves in their plaids
          and slept round the bonfire, which was intended to last all
          night.<a id="noteref_530" name="noteref_530" href=

          Thomas Moresin of Aberdeen, a writer of the sixteenth century, says
          that on St. Peter's Day, which is the twenty-ninth of June, the

          high grounds, <span class="tei tei-q">“as Ceres did when she roamed

          are still lit on Midsummer Eve. They are kept up all night, and the
          children leap over them in a certain rhythmical way which is said
          to resemble the ancient dances. On the coast, people at this season
          plunge into the sea; in the inland districts the villagers go and
          roll naked in the dew of the meadows, which is supposed to be a
          sovereign preservative against diseases of the skin. On this
          evening, too, girls who would pry into the future put a vessel of
          water on the sill outside their window; and when the clocks strike
          twelve, they break an egg in the water and see, or fancy they see,
          in the shapes assumed by the pulp, as it blends with the liquid,
          the likeness of future bridegrooms, castles, coffins, and so forth.
          But generally, as might perhaps have been anticipated, the obliging
          egg exhibits the features of a bridegroom.<a id="noteref_533" name=

          the Azores, also, bonfires are lit on Midsummer Eve (St. John's
          Eve), and boys jump over them for luck. On that night St. John
          himself is supposed to appear in person and bless all the seas and
          waters, driving out the devils and demons who had been disporting
          themselves in them ever since the second day of November; that is
          why in the interval between the second of November and the
          twenty-third of June nobody will bathe in the sea or in a hot
          spring. On Midsummer Eve, too, you can always see the devil, if you
          will go into a garden at midnight. He is invariably found standing
          near a mustard-plant. His reason for adopting this posture has not
          been ascertained; perhaps in the chilly air of the upper world he
          is attracted by the genial warmth of the mustard. Various forms of
          divination are practised by people in the Azores on Midsummer Eve.
          Thus a new-laid egg is broken <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page209">[pg 209]</span><a name="Pg209" id="Pg209" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> into a glass of water, and the shapes which
          it assumes foreshadow the fate of the person concerned. Again,
          seven saucers are placed in a row, filled respectively with water,
          earth, ashes, keys, a thimble, money, and grass, which things
          signify travel, death, widowhood, housekeeping, spinsterhood,
          riches, and farming. A blindfolded person touches one or other of
          the saucers with a wand and so discovers his or her fate. Again,
          three broad beans are taken; one is left in its skin, one is half
          peeled, and the third is peeled outright. The three denote
          respectively riches, competence, and poverty. They are hidden and
          searched for; and he who finds one of them knows accordingly
          whether he will be rich, moderately well-off, or poor. Again, girls
          take slips of paper and write the names of young men twice over on
          them. These they fold up and crumple and place one set under their
          pillows and the other set in a saucer full of water. In the morning
          they draw one slip of paper from under their pillow, and see
          whether one in the water has opened out. If the names on the two
          slips are the same, it is the name of her future husband. Young men
          do the same with girls' names. Once more, if a girl rises at
          sunrise, goes out into the street, and asks the first passer-by his
          Christian name, that will be her husband's name.<a id="noteref_534"

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Passing to
          Italy, we find that the midsummer fires are still lighted on St.
          John's Eve in many parts of the Abruzzi. They are commonest in the
          territory which was inhabited in antiquity by the Vestini; they are
          rarer in the land of the ancient Marsi, and they disappear entirely
          in the lower valley <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page210">[pg
          210]</span><a name="Pg210" id="Pg210" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          of the Sangro. For the most part, the fires are fed with straw and
          dry grass, and are kindled in the fields near the villages or on
          high ground. As they blaze up, the people dance round or over them.
          In leaping across the flames the boys cry out, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“St. John, preserve my thighs and legs!”</span>
          Formerly it used to be common to light the bonfires also in the
          towns in front of churches of St. John, and the remains of the
          sacred fire were carried home by the people; but this custom has
          mostly fallen into disuse. However, at Celano the practice is still
          kept up of taking brands and ashes from the bonfires to the houses,
          although the fires are no longer kindled in front of the churches,
          but merely in the streets.<a id="noteref_538" name="noteref_538"

          the Abruzzi water also is supposed to acquire certain marvellous
          and beneficent properties on St. John's Night. Hence many people
          bathe or at least wash their faces and hands in the sea or a river
          at that season, especially at the moment of sunrise. Such a bath is
          said to be an excellent cure for diseases of the skin. At
          Castiglione a Casauria the people, after washing in the river or in
          springs, gird their waists and wreath their brows with sprigs of
          briony in order to keep them from aches and pains.<a id=

          various parts of Sicily, also, fires are kindled on Midsummer Eve
          (St. John's Eve), the twenty-third of June. On the Madonie
          mountains, in the north of the island, the herdsmen kindle them at
          intervals, so that the crests of the mountains are seen ablaze in
          the darkness for many miles. About Acireale, on the east coast of
          the island, the bonfires are lit by boys, who jump over them. At
          Chiaromonte the witches that night acquire extraordinary powers;
          hence everybody then puts a broom outside of his house, because a
          broom is an excellent protective against witchcraft.<a id=

          gather straw, twigs, and all sorts of other combustibles, which
          they store up for St. John's Eve. On the night of the twenty-third
          of June, the day before the festival of the Saint, great fires are
          kindled in the streets, squares, and market places of the towns and
          villages of the Island, and as fire after fire blazes out of the
          darkness of that summer night, the effect is singularly striking.
          These fires are sometimes kept up for hours, being continually fed
          by the scores of bystanders, who take great delight in throwing
          amidst the flames some old rickety piece of furniture which they
          consider as lumber in their houses. Lots of happy and reckless
          children, and very often men, are seen merrily leaping in

          and two bailiffs, to set fire to some pitch barrels which were
          placed for the occasion in the square facing the sacred Hospital.
          Great crowds used to assemble here in order to assist at this
          ceremony. The setting ablaze of the five casks, and later on of the
          eight casks, by the Grand Master, was a signal for the others to

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The custom of
          kindling bonfires on Midsummer Day or on Midsummer Eve is widely
          spread among the Mohammedan peoples of North Africa, particularly
          in Morocco and Algeria; it is common both to the Berbers and to
          many of the Arabs or Arabic-speaking tribes. In these countries
          Midsummer Day (the twenty-fourth of June, Old Style) is called
          <span lang="ar" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="ar"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">l'ánṣăra</span></span>. The fires are lit in
          the courtyards, at cross-roads, in the fields, and sometimes on the
          threshing-floors. Plants which in burning give out a thick smoke
          and an aromatic smell are much sought after for fuel on these
          occasions; among the plants used for the purpose are giant-fennel,
          thyme, rue, chervil-seed, camomile, geranium, and penny-royal.
          People expose themselves, and especially their children, to the
          smoke, and drive it towards the orchards and the crops. Also they
          leap across the fires; in some places everybody ought to repeat the
          leap seven times. Moreover they take burning brands from the fires
          and carry them through the houses in order to fumigate them. They
          pass things through the fire, and bring the sick into contact with
          it, while they utter prayers for their recovery. The ashes of the
          bonfires are also reputed to possess beneficial properties; hence
          in some places people rub their hair or their bodies with
          them.<a id="noteref_552" name="noteref_552" href=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">552</span></span></a> For
          example, the Andjra <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page214">[pg
          214]</span><a name="Pg214" id="Pg214" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          mountaineers of Morocco kindle large fires in open places of their
          villages on Midsummer Day. Men, women, and children jump over the
          flames or the glowing embers, believing that by so doing they rid
          themselves of all misfortune which may be clinging to them; they
          imagine, also, that such leaps cure the sick and procure offspring
          for childless couples. Moreover, they burn straw, together with
          some marjoram and alum, in the fold where the cattle, sheep, and
          goats are penned for the night; the smoke, in their opinion, will
          make the animals thrive. On Midsummer Day the Arabs of the Mnasara
          tribe make fires outside their tents, near their animals, on their
          fields, and in their gardens. Large quantities of penny-royal are
          burned in these fires, and over some of them the people leap thrice
          to and fro. Sometimes small fires are also kindled inside the
          tents. They say that the smoke confers blessings on everything with
          which it comes into contact. At Salee, on the Atlantic coast of
          Morocco, persons who suffer from diseased eyes rub them with the
          ashes of the midsummer fire; and in Casablanca and Azemmur the
          people hold their faces over the fire, because the smoke is thought
          to be good for the eyes. The Arab tribe Ulad Bu Aziz, in the
          Dukkala province of Morocco, kindle midsummer bonfires, not for
          themselves and their cattle, but only for crops and fruit; nobody
          likes to reap his crops before Midsummer Day, because if he did
          they would lose the benefit of the blessed influence which flows
          from the smoke of the bonfires. <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page215">[pg 215]</span><a name="Pg215" id="Pg215" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> Again, the Beni Mgild, a Berber tribe of
          Morocco, light fires of straw on Midsummer Eve and leap thrice over
          them to and fro. They let some of the smoke pass underneath their
          clothes, and married women hold their breasts over the fire, in
          order that their children may be strong. Moreover, they paint their
          eyes and lips with some black powder, in which ashes of the bonfire
          are mixed. And in order that their horses may also benefit by the
          fires, they dip the right forelegs of the animals in the smoke and
          flames or in the hot embers, and they rub ashes on the foreheads
          and between the nostrils of the horses. Berbers of the Rif
          province, in northern Morocco, similarly make great use of fires at
          midsummer for the good of themselves, their cattle, and their
          fruit-trees. They jump over the bonfires in the belief that this
          will preserve them in good health, and they light fires under
          fruit-trees to keep the fruit from falling untimely. And they
          imagine that by rubbing a paste of the ashes on their hair they
          prevent the hair from falling off their heads.<a id="noteref_553"

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In all these
          Moroccan customs, we are told, the beneficial effect is attributed
          wholly to the smoke, which is supposed to be endued with a magical
          quality that removes misfortune from men, animals, fruit-trees, and
          crops. But in some parts of Morocco people at midsummer kindle
          fires of a different sort, not for the sake of fumigation, but in
          order to burn up misfortune in the flames. Thus on Midsummer Eve
          the Berber tribe of the Beni Mgild burn three sheaves of unthreshed
          wheat or barley, <span class="tei tei-q">“one for the children, one
          for the crops, and one for the animals.”</span> On the same
          occasion they burn the tent of a widow who has never given birth to
          a child; by so doing they think to rid the village of ill luck. It
          is said that at midsummer the Zemmur burn a tent, which belongs to
          somebody who was killed in war during a feast; or if there is no
          such person in the village, the schoolmaster's tent is burned
          instead. Among the Arabic-speaking Beni Ahsen it is customary for
          those who live near the river Sbu to make a little hut of straw at
          midsummer, set it on fire, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page216">[pg 216]</span><a name="Pg216" id="Pg216" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> and let it float down the river. Similarly
          the inhabitants of Salee burn a straw hut on the river which flows
          past their town.<a id="noteref_554" name="noteref_554" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Further it
          deserves to be noticed that in Northern Africa, as in Southern
          Europe, the midsummer festival comprises rites concerned with water
          as well as with fire. For example, among the Beni-Snous the women
          light a fire in an oven, throw perfumes into it, and circumambulate
          a tank, which they also incense after a fashion. In many places on
          the coast, as in the province of Oran and particularly in the north
          of Morocco, everybody goes and bathes in the sea at midsummer; and
          in many towns of the interior, such as Fez, Mequinez, and
          especially Merrakech, people throw water over each other on this
          day; and where water is scarce, earth is used instead, according to
          the Mohammedan principle which permits ablutions to be performed
          with earth or sand when water cannot be spared for the
          purpose.<a id="noteref_555" name="noteref_555" href=

          People of the Andjra district in Morocco not only bathe themselves
          in the sea or in rivers at midsummer, they also bathe their
          animals, their horses, mules, donkeys, cattle, sheep, and goats;
          for they think that on that day water possesses a blessed virtue
          (<span lang="ar" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="ar"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">baraka</span></span>), which removes sickness
          and misfortune. In Aglu, again, men, women, and children bathe in
          the sea or springs or rivers at midsummer, alleging that by so
          doing they protect themselves against disease for the whole year.
          Among the Berbers of the Rif district the custom of bathing on this
          day is commonly observed, and animals share the ablutions.<a id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The celebration
          of a midsummer festival by Mohammedan peoples is particularly
          remarkable, because the Mohammedan calendar, being purely lunar and
          uncorrected by intercalation, necessarily takes no note of
          festivals which occupy fixed points in the solar year; all strictly
          Mohammedan feasts, being pinned to the moon, slide <span class=

          the whole period of the earth's revolution about the sun. This fact
          of itself seems to prove that among the Mohammedan peoples of
          Northern Africa, as among the Christian peoples of Europe, the
          midsummer festival is quite independent of the religion which the
          people publicly profess, and is a relic of a far older paganism.
          There are, indeed, independent grounds for thinking that the Arabs
          enjoyed the advantage of a comparatively well-regulated solar year
          before the prophet of God saddled them with the absurdity and
          inconvenience of a purely lunar calendar.<a id="noteref_557" name=

          that as it may, it is notable that some Mohammedan people of North
          Africa kindle fires and bathe in water at the movable New Year of
          their lunar calendar instead of at the fixed Midsummer of the solar
          year; while others again practise these observances at both
          seasons. New Year's Day, on which the rites are celebrated, is
          called <span lang="ar" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=

          the tenth day of Moharram, the first month of the Mohammedan
          calendar. On that day bonfires are kindled in Tunis and also at
          Merrakech and among some tribes of the neighbourhood.<a id=

          Demnat, in the Great Atlas mountains, people kindle a large bonfire
          on New Year's Eve and leap to and fro over the flames, uttering
          words which imply that by these leaps they think to purify
          themselves from all kinds of evil. At Aglu, in the province of Sus,
          the fire is lighted at three different points by an unmarried girl,
          and when it has died down the young men leap over the glowing
          embers, saying, <span class="tei tei-q">“We shook on you, O Lady
          Ashur, fleas, and lice, and the illnesses of the heart, as also
          those of the bones; we shall pass through you again next year and
          the following years with safety and health.”</span> Both at Aglu
          and Glawi, in the Great Atlas, smaller fires are also kindled, over
          which the animals <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page218">[pg
          218]</span><a name="Pg218" id="Pg218" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          are driven. At Demnat girls who wish to marry wash themselves in
          water which has been boiled over the New Year fire; and in Dukkala
          people use the ashes of that fire to rub sore eyes with. New Year
          fires appear to be commonly kindled among the Berbers who inhabit
          the western portion of the Great Atlas, and also among the
          Arabic-speaking tribes of the plains; but Dr. Westermarck found no
          traces of such fires among the Arabic-speaking mountaineers of
          Northern Morocco and the Berbers of the Rif province. Further, it
          should be observed that water ceremonies like those which are
          practised at Midsummer are very commonly observed in Morocco at the
          New Year, that is, on the tenth day of the first month. On the
          morning of that day (<span lang="ar" class="tei tei-foreign"
          xml:lang="ar"><span style="font-style: italic">Ashur</span></span>)
          all water or, according to some people, only spring water is
          endowed with a magical virtue (<span lang="ar" class=

          sunrise. Hence at that time the people bathe and pour water over
          each other; in some places they also sprinkle their animals, tents,
          or rooms. In Dukkala some of the New Year water is preserved at
          home till New Year's Day (<span lang="ar" class="tei tei-foreign"

          is poured on the place where the corn is threshed, and some is used
          to water the money which is to be buried in the ground; for the
          people think that the earth-spirits will not be able to steal the
          buried treasures which have thus been sanctified with the holy

          the Romans, which was based on the sun, and the newer Mohammedan
          calendar of the Arabs, which is based on the moon. For not only was
          the Julian calendar in use throughout the whole of Northern Africa
          under the Roman Empire; to this day it is everywhere employed among
          Mohammedans for the regulation of agriculture and all the affairs
          of daily life; its practical convenience has made it indispensable,
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page219">[pg 219]</span><a name=
          "Pg219" id="Pg219" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> and the lunar
          calendar of orthodox Mohammedanism is scarcely used except for
          purposes of chronology. Even the old Latin names of the months are
          known and employed, in slightly disguised forms, throughout the
          whole Moslem world; and little calendars of the Julian year
          circulate in manuscript among Mohammedans, permitting them to
          combine the practical advantages of pagan science with a nominal
          adherence to orthodox absurdity.<a id="noteref_560" name=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">560</span></span></a> Thus
          the heathen origin of the midsummer festival is too palpable to
          escape the attention of good Mohammedans, who accordingly frown
          upon the midsummer bonfires as pagan superstitions, precisely as
          similar observances in Europe have often been denounced by orthodox
          Christianity. Indeed, many religious people in Morocco entirely
          disapprove of the whole of the midsummer ceremonies, maintaining
          that they are all bad; and a conscientious schoolmaster will even
          refuse his pupils a holiday at midsummer, though the boys sometimes
          offer him a bribe if he will sacrifice his scruples to his
          avarice.<a id="noteref_561" name="noteref_561" href=

          the midsummer customs appear to flourish among all the Berbers of
          Morocco but to be unknown among the pure Arabs who have not been
          affected by Berber influence, it seems reasonable to infer with Dr.
          Westermarck that the midsummer festival has belonged from time
          immemorial to the Berber race, and that so far as it is now
          observed by the Arabs of Morocco, it has been learned by them from
          the Berbers, the old indigenous inhabitants of the country. Dr.
          Westermarck may also be right in holding that, in spite of the
          close similarity which obtains between the midsummer festival of
          Europe and the midsummer festival of North Africa, the latter is
          not a copy of the former, but that both have been handed down
          independently from a time beyond the purview of history, when such
          ceremonies were common to the Mediterranean race.<a id=

          opposite to one of the mouths of which the priest stands with a
          sprinkler in his hand, with which he sprinkles them. As soon as the

          former; the birch, which is somewhat softer than the plane, in a

          221]</span><a name="Pg221" id="Pg221" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          friend Professor A. E. Housman, who witnessed the celebration in
          different years at both places, has kindly furnished me with the
          following particulars: <span class="tei tei-q">“In 1906 I was in
          the island of Capri on September the eighth, the feast of the
          Nativity of the Virgin. The anniversary was duly solemnised by
          fire-works at nine or ten in the evening, which I suppose were
          municipal; but just after sundown the boys outside the villages
          were making small fires of brushwood on waste bits of ground by the
          wayside. Very pretty it looked, with the flames blowing about in
          the twilight; but what took my attention was the listlessness of
          the boys and their lack of interest in the proceeding. A single
          lad, the youngest, would be raking the fire together and keeping it
          alight, but the rest stood lounging about and looking in every
          other direction, with the air of discharging mechanically a
          traditional office from which all zest had evaporated.”</span>
          <span class="tei tei-q">“The pious orgy at Naples on September the
          eighth went through the following phases when I witnessed it in
          1897. It began at eight in the evening with an illumination of the
          façade of Santa Maria Piedigrotta and with the whole population
          walking about blowing penny trumpets. After four hours of this I
          went to bed at midnight, and was lulled to sleep by barrel-organs,
          which supersede the trumpets about that hour. At four in the
          morning I was waked by detonations as if the British fleet were
          bombarding the city, caused, I was afterwards told, by dynamite
          rockets. The only step possible beyond this is assassination, which
          accordingly takes place about peep of day: I forget now the number
          of the slain, but I think the average is eight or ten, and I know
          that in honour of my presence they murdered a few more than
          usual.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is no doubt
          possible that these illuminations and fire-works, like the
          assassinations, are merely the natural and spontaneous expressions
          of that overflowing joy with which the thought of the birth of the
          Virgin must fill every pious heart; but when we remember how often
          the Church has skilfully decanted the new wine of Christianity into
          the old bottles of heathendom, we may be allowed to conjecture that
          the ecclesiastical authorities adroitly timed the Nativity of the
          Virgin so as to coincide with an old pagan festival <span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From the
          foregoing survey we may infer that among the heathen forefathers of
          the European peoples the most popular and widespread fire-festival
          of the year was the great celebration of Midsummer Eve or Midsummer
          Day. The coincidence of the festival with the summer solstice can
          hardly be accidental. Rather we must suppose that our pagan
          ancestors purposely timed the ceremony of fire on earth to coincide
          with the arrival of the sun at the highest point of his course in
          the sky. If that was so, it follows that the old founders of the
          midsummer rites had observed the solstices or turning-points of the
          sun's apparent path in the sky, and that they accordingly regulated
          their festal calendar to some extent by astronomical
          considerations.</p>

              <span style="font-size: 80%">On the other hand the Celts
              divided their year, not by the solstices, but by the beginning
              of summer (the first of May) and the beginning of winter (the
              first of November). The division seems to have been neither
              astronomical nor agricultural but pastoral, being determined by
              the times when cattle are driven to and from their summer
              pasture.</span>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But while this
          may be regarded as fairly certain for what we may call the
          aborigines throughout a large part of the continent, it appears not
          to have been true of the Celtic peoples who inhabited the Land's
          End of Europe, the islands and promontories that stretch out into
          the Atlantic ocean on the North-West. The principal fire-festivals
          of the Celts, which have survived, though in a restricted area and
          with diminished pomp, to modern times and even to our own day, were
          seemingly timed without any reference to the position of the sun in
          the heaven. They were two in number, and fell at an interval of six
          months, one being celebrated on the eve of May Day and the other on
          Allhallow Even or Hallowe'en, as it is now commonly called, that
          is, on the thirty-first of October, the day preceding All Saints'
          or Allhallows' Day. These dates coincide with none of the four
          great hinges on which the solar year revolves, to wit, the
          solstices and the equinoxes. Nor do they agree with the principal
          seasons of the agricultural <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page223">[pg 223]</span><a name="Pg223" id="Pg223" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> year, the sowing in spring and the reaping in
          autumn. For when May Day comes, the seed has long been committed to
          the earth; and when November opens, the harvest has long been
          reaped and garnered, the fields lie bare, the fruit-trees are
          stripped, and even the yellow leaves are fast fluttering to the
          ground. Yet the first of May and the first of November mark
          turning-points of the year in Europe; the one ushers in the genial
          heat and the rich vegetation of summer, the other heralds, if it
          does not share, the cold and barrenness of winter. Now these
          particular points of the year, as has been well pointed out by a
          learned and ingenious writer,<a id="noteref_566" name="noteref_566"
          href="#note_566"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">566</span></span></a> while
          they are of comparatively little moment to the European husbandman,
          do deeply concern the European herdsman; for it is on the approach
          of summer that he drives his cattle out into the open to crop the
          fresh grass, and it is on the approach of winter that he leads them
          back to the safety and shelter of the stall. Accordingly it seems
          not improbable that the Celtic bisection of the year into two
          halves at the beginning of May and the beginning of November dates
          from a time when the Celts were mainly a pastoral people, dependent
          for their subsistence on their herds, and when accordingly the
          great epochs of the year for them were the days on which the cattle
          went forth from the homestead in early summer and returned to it
          again in early winter.<a id="noteref_567" name="noteref_567" href=
          "#note_567"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">567</span></span></a> Even
          in Central Europe, remote from the region now occupied by the
          Celts, a similar bisection of the year may be clearly traced in the
          great popularity, on the one hand, of May Day and its Eve
          (Walpurgis Night), and, on the other hand, of the Feast of All
          Souls at the beginning of November, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          we may conjecture that everywhere throughout Europe the celestial
          division of the year according to the solstices was preceded by
          what we may call a terrestrial division of the year according to
          the beginning of summer and the beginning of winter.</p>

          in which the Celtic language and lore longest held out against the
          siege of the Saxon invaders, the first of November, Old Style, has
          been regarded as New Year's day down to recent times. Thus Manx
          mummers used to go round on Hallowe'en (Old Style), singing, in the
          Manx language, a sort of Hogmanay song which began <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“To-night is New Year's Night, <span lang="gv" class=

          of Sir John Rhys's Manx informants, an old man of sixty-seven,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“had been a farm servant from the age of
          sixteen till he was twenty-six to the same man, near Regaby, in the
          parish of Andreas, and he remembers his master and a near neighbour
          of his discussing the term New Year's Day as applied to the first
          of November, and explaining to the younger men that it had always
          been so in old <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page225">[pg
          225]</span><a name="Pg225" id="Pg225" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          times. In fact, it seemed to him natural enough, as all tenure of
          land ends at that time, and as all servant men begin their service
          then.”</span><a id="noteref_571" name="noteref_571" href=
          "#note_571"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">571</span></span></a> In
          ancient Ireland, as we saw, a new fire used to be kindled every
          year on Hallowe'en or the Eve of Samhain, and from this sacred
          flame all the fires in Ireland were rekindled.<a id="noteref_572"
          name="noteref_572" href="#note_572"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">572</span></span></a> Such
          a custom points strongly to Samhain or All Saints' Day (the first
          of November) as New Year's Day; since the annual kindling of a new
          fire takes place most naturally at the beginning of the year, in
          order that the blessed influence of the fresh fire may last
          throughout the whole period of twelve months. Another confirmation
          of the view that the Celts dated their year from the first of
          November is furnished by the manifold modes of divination which, as
          we shall see presently, were commonly resorted to by Celtic peoples
          on Hallowe'en for the purpose of ascertaining their destiny,
          especially their fortune in the coming year; for when could these
          devices for prying into the future be more reasonably put in
          practice than at the beginning of the year? As a season of omens
          and auguries Hallowe'en seems to have far surpassed Beltane in the
          imagination of the Celts; from which we may with some probability
          infer that they reckoned their year from Hallowe'en rather than
          Beltane. Another circumstance of great moment which points to the
          same conclusion is the association of the dead with Hallowe'en. Not
          only among the Celts but throughout Europe, Hallowe'en, the night
          which marks the transition from autumn to winter, seems to have
          been of old the time of year when the souls of the departed were
          supposed to revisit their old homes in order to warm themselves by
          the fire and to comfort themselves with the good cheer provided for
          them in the kitchen or the parlour by their affectionate
          kinsfolk.<a id="noteref_573" name="noteref_573" href=

          natural thought that the approach of winter should drive the poor
          shivering hungry ghosts from the bare fields and the leafless
          woodlands to the shelter of the cottage with its familiar
          fireside.<a id="noteref_574" name="noteref_574" href=

          forests and on the hills to be fed and cared for in the stalls,
          while the bleak winds whistled among the swaying boughs and the
          snow drifts deepened in the hollows? and could the good-man and the
          good-wife deny to the spirits of their dead the welcome which they
          gave to the cows?</p>

          though the fairies are a kindlier folk, it is dangerous to see even
          them at their revels on Hallowe'en. A melancholy case of this sort
          is reported from the Ferintosh district of the Highlands, though
          others say that it happened at the Slope of Big Stones in Harris.
          Two young men were coming home after nightfall on Hallowe'en, each
          with a jar of whisky on his back, when they saw, as they thought, a
          house all lit up by the roadside, from which proceeded the sounds
          of music and dancing. In reality it was not a house at all but a
          fairy knoll, and it was the fairies who were jigging it about there
          so merrily. But one of the young men was deceived and stepping into
          the house joined in the dance, without even stopping to put down
          the jar of whisky. His companion was wiser; he had a shrewd
          suspicion that the place was not what it seemed, and on entering he
          took the precaution of sticking a needle in the door. That disarmed
          the power of the fairies, and he got away safely. Well, that day
          twelve months he came back to the spot and what should he see but
          his poor friend still dancing away with the jar of whisky on his
          back? A weary man was he, as you may well believe, but he begged to
          be allowed to finish the reel which he was in the act of executing,
          and when they took him out into the open air, there was nothing of
          him left but skin and bones.<a id="noteref_580" name="noteref_580"

          Again, the wicked fairies are apt to carry off men's wives with
          them to fairyland; but the lost spouses can be recovered within a
          year and a day when the procession of the fairies is defiling past
          on Hallowe'en, always provided that the mortals did not partake of
          elfin food while they were in elfinland.<a id="noteref_581" name=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Sometimes
          valuable information may be obtained from the fairies on
          Hallowe'en. There was a young man named <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page228">[pg 228]</span><a name="Pg228" id="Pg228" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> Guleesh in the County of Mayo. Near his house
          was a <span lang="ga" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
          "ga"><span style="font-style: italic">rath</span></span> or old
          fort with a fine grass bank running round it. One Hallowe'en, when
          the darkness was falling, Guleesh went to the rath and stood on a
          gray old flag. The night was calm and still; there was not a breath
          of wind stirring, nor a sound to be heard except the hum of the
          insects flitting past, or the whistle of the plovers, or the hoarse
          scream of the wild geese as they winged their way far overhead.
          Above the white fog the moon rose like a knob of fire in the east,
          and a thousand thousand stars were twinkling in the sky. There was
          a little frost in the air, the grass was white and crisp and
          crackled under foot. Guleesh expected to see the fairies, but they
          did not come. Hour after hour wore away, and he was just bethinking
          him of going home to bed, when his ear caught a sound far off
          coming towards him, and he knew what it was in a moment. The sound
          grew louder and louder; at first it was like the beating of waves
          on a stony shore, then it was like the roar of a waterfall, at last
          it was like a mighty rushing wind in the tops of the trees, then
          the storm burst upon the rath, and sure enough the fairies were in
          it. The rout went by so suddenly that Guleesh lost his breath; but
          he came to himself and listened. The fairies were now gathered
          within the grassy bank of the rath, and a fine uproar they made.
          But Guleesh listened with all his ears, and he heard one fairy
          saying to another that a magic herb grew by Guleesh's own door, and
          that Guleesh had nothing to do but pluck it and boil it and give it
          to his sweetheart, the daughter of the King of France, and she
          would be well, for just then she was lying very ill. Guleesh took
          the hint, and everything went as the fairy had said. And he married
          the daughter of the King of France; and they had never a cark nor a
          care, a sickness nor a sorrow, a mishap nor a misfortune to the day
          of their death.<a id="noteref_582" name="noteref_582" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But while a
          glamour of mystery and awe has always clung to Hallowe'en in the
          minds of the Celtic peasantry, the popular celebration of the
          festival has been, at least in modern times, by no means of a
          prevailingly gloomy cast; on the contrary it has been attended by
          picturesque features and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page230">[pg
          230]</span><a name="Pg230" id="Pg230" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          merry pastimes, which rendered it the gayest night of all the year.
          Amongst the things which in the Highlands of Scotland contributed
          to invest the festival with a romantic beauty were the bonfires
          which used to blaze at frequent intervals on the heights.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“On the last day of autumn children
          gathered ferns, tar-barrels, the long thin stalks called
          <span lang="gd" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="gd"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">gàinisg</span></span>, and everything suitable
          for a bonfire. These were placed in a heap on some eminence near
          the house, and in the evening set fire to. The fires were called
          <span lang="gd" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="gd"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Samhnagan</span></span>. There was one for
          each house, and it was an object of ambition who should have the
          biggest. Whole districts were brilliant with bonfires, and their
          glare across a Highland loch, and from many eminences, formed an
          exceedingly picturesque scene.”</span><a id="noteref_587" name=

          the Beltane fires on the first of May, the Hallowe'en bonfires seem
          to have been kindled most commonly in the Perthshire Highlands.
          Travelling in the parish of Moulin, near Pitlochrie, in the year
          1772, the Englishman Thomas Pennant writes that <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Hallow Eve is also kept sacred: as soon as it is dark,
          a person sets fire to a bush of broom fastened round a pole, and,
          attended with a crowd, runs about the village. He then flings it
          down, heaps great quantity of combustible matters on it, and makes
          a great bonfire. A whole tract is thus illuminated at the same
          time, and makes a fine appearance.”</span><a id="noteref_588" name=

          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">588</span></span></a> The
          custom has been described more fully by a Scotchman of the
          eighteenth century, John Ramsay of Ochtertyre. On the evening of
          Hallowe'en <span class="tei tei-q">“the young people of every
          hamlet assembled upon some eminence near the houses. There they
          made a bonfire of ferns or other fuel, cut the same day, which from
          the feast was called <span lang="gd" class="tei tei-foreign"
          xml:lang="gd"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Samh-nag</span></span> or <span lang="gd"
          class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="gd"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Savnag</span></span>, a fire of rest and
          pleasure. Around it was placed a circle of stones, one for each
          person of the families to whom they belonged. And when it grew dark
          the bonfire was kindled, at which a loud shout was set up. Then
          each person taking a torch of ferns or sticks in his hand, ran
          round the fire exulting; and sometimes <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page231">[pg 231]</span><a name="Pg231" id="Pg231" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> times they went into the adjacent fields,
          where, if there was another company, they visited the bonfire,
          taunting the others if inferior in any respect to themselves. After
          the fire was burned out they returned home, where a feast was
          prepared, and the remainder of the evening was spent in mirth and
          diversions of various kinds. Next morning they repaired betimes to
          the bonfire, where the situation of the stones was examined with
          much attention. If any of them were misplaced, or if the print of a
          foot could be discerned near any particular stone, it was imagined
          that the person for whom it was set would not live out the year. Of
          late years this is less attended to, but about the beginning of the
          present century it was regarded as a sure prediction. The
          Hallowe'en fire is still kept up in some parts of the Low country;
          but on the western coast and in the Isles it is never kindled,
          though the night is spent in merriment and
          entertainments.”</span><a id="noteref_589" name="noteref_589" href=

          the Perthshire parish of Callander, which includes the now famous
          pass of the Trossachs opening out on the winding and wooded shores
          of the lovely Loch Katrine, the Hallowe'en bonfires were still
          kindled down to near the end of the eighteenth century. When the
          fire had died down, the ashes were carefully collected in the form
          of a circle, and a stone was put in, near the circumference, for
          every person of the several families interested in the bonfire.
          Next morning, if any of these stones was found to be displaced or
          injured, the people made sure that the person represented by it was
          <span lang="gd" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="gd"><span style=

          the parish of Logierait, which covers the beautiful valley of the
          Tummel, one of the fairest regions of all Scotland, the Hallowe'en
          fire was somewhat different. Faggots of heath, broom, and the
          dressings of flax were kindled and carried on poles by men, who ran
          with them round the villages, attended by a crowd. As soon as one
          faggot was burnt out, a fresh one was lighted and fastened to the
          pole. Numbers of these blazing faggots were often carried about
          together, and when <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page232">[pg

          Again, <span class="tei tei-q">“in 1860, I was residing near the
          head of Loch Tay during the season of the Hallowe'en feast. For
          several days before Hallowe'en, boys and youths collected wood and
          conveyed it to the most prominent places on the hill sides in their
          neighbourhood. Some of the heaps were as large as a corn-stack or
          hay-rick. After dark on Hallowe'en, these heaps were kindled, and
          for several hours both sides of Loch Tay were illuminated as far as
          the eye could see. I was told by old men that at the beginning of
          this century men as well as boys took part in getting up the
          bonfires, and that, when the fire was ablaze, all joined hands and
          danced round the fire, and made a great noise; but that, as these
          gatherings generally ended in drunkenness and rough and dangerous
          fun, the ministers set their faces against the observance, and were
          seconded in their efforts by the more intelligent and well-behaved
          in the community; and so the practice was discontinued by adults
          and relegated to school boys.”</span><a id="noteref_593" name=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Hallowe'en fires
          were also lighted in some districts of the north-east of Scotland,
          such as Buchan. Villagers and farmers alike must have their fire.
          In the villages the boys went from house to house and begged a peat
          from each householder, usually with the words, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Ge's a peat t' burn <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page233">[pg 233]</span><a name="Pg233" id="Pg233" class=

          lads collected the peats in a cart, some of them drawing it along
          and the others receiving the peats and loading them on the cart.
          Along with the peats they accumulated straw, furze, potato haulm,
          everything that would burn quickly, and when they had got enough
          they piled it all in a heap and set it on fire. Then each of the
          youths, one after another, laid himself down on the ground as near
          to the fire as he could without being scorched, and thus lying
          allowed the smoke to roll over him. The others ran through the
          smoke and jumped over their prostrate comrade. When the heap was
          burned down, they scattered the ashes. Each one took a share in
          this part of the ceremony, giving a kick first with the right foot
          and then with the left; and each vied with the other who should
          scatter the most. After that some of them still continued to run
          through the scattered ashes and to pelt each other with the
          half-burned peats. At each farm a spot as high as possible, not too
          near the steading, was chosen for the fire, and the proceedings
          were much the same as at the village bonfire. The lads of one farm,
          when their own fire was burned down and the ashes scattered,
          sometimes went to a neighbouring fire and helped to kick the ashes
          about.<a id="noteref_595" name="noteref_595" href=

          Referring to this part of Scotland, a writer at the end of the
          eighteenth century observes that <span class="tei tei-q">“the
          Hallow-even fire, another relict of druidism, was kindled in
          Buchan. Various magic ceremonies were then celebrated to counteract
          the influence of witches and demons, and to prognosticate to the
          young their success or disappointment in the matrimonial lottery.
          These being devoutly finished, the hallow fire was kindled, and
          guarded by the male part of the family. Societies were formed,
          either by pique or humour, to scatter certain fires, and the attack
          and defence were often conducted with art and with
          fury.”</span><a id="noteref_596" name="noteref_596" href=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">596</span></span></a> Down
          to about the middle of the nineteenth century <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“the Braemar Highlanders made the circuit of their
          fields with lighted torches at Hallowe'en to ensure their fertility

          234]</span><a name="Pg234" id="Pg234" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          At that date the custom was as follows: Every member of the family
          (in those days households were larger than they are now) was
          provided with a bundle of fir <span class=
          "tei tei-q">‘can'les’</span> with which to go the round. The father
          and mother stood at the hearth and lit the splints in the peat
          fire, which they passed to the children and servants, who trooped
          out one after the other, and proceeded to tread the bounds of their
          little property, going slowly round at equal distances apart, and
          invariably with the sun. To go <span class=

          cursing and excommunication. When the fields had thus been

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the Highlands
          of Scotland, as the evening of Hallowe'en wore on, young people
          gathered in one of the houses and resorted to an almost endless
          variety of games, or rather forms of divination, for the purpose of
          ascertaining the future fate of each member of the company. Were
          they to marry or remain single, was the marriage to take place that
          year or never, who was to be married first, what sort of husband or
          wife she or he was to get, the name, the trade, the colour of the
          hair, the amount of property of the future spouse—these were
          questions that were eagerly canvassed and the answers to them
          furnished never-failing entertainment.<a id="noteref_598" name=
          "noteref_598" href="#note_598"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">598</span></span></a> Nor
          were these modes of divination at Hallowe'en confined to the
          Highlands, where the bonfires were kindled; they were practised
          with equal faith and in practically the same forms in the Lowlands,
          as we learn, for example, from Burns's poem <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Hallowe'en</span></span>, which describes the
          auguries drawn from a variety of omens by the Ayrshire peasantry.
          These Lowlanders of Saxon descent may well have inherited the rites
          from the Celts who preceded them in the possession of the south
          country. A common practice at Hallowe'en was to go out stealthily
          to a neighbour's kailyard and there, with shut eyes, to pull up the
          first kail <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page235">[pg
          235]</span><a name="Pg235" id="Pg235" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          stock that came to hand. It was necessary that the plants should be
          stolen without the knowledge or consent of their owner; otherwise
          they were quite useless for the purpose of divination. Strictly
          speaking, too, the neighbour upon whose garden the raid was made
          should be unmarried, whether a bachelor or a spinster. The stolen
          kail was taken home and examined, and according to its height,
          shape, and features would be the height, shape, and features of the
          future husband or wife. The taste of the <span lang="gd" class=
          "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="gd"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">custock</span></span>, that is, the heart of
          the stem, was an infallible indication of his or her temper; and a
          clod of earth adhering to the root signified, in proportion to its
          size, the amount of property which he or she would bring to the
          common stock. Then the kail-stock or <span lang="gd" class=
          "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="gd"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">runt</span></span>, as it was called in
          Ayrshire, was placed over the lintel of the door; and the baptismal
          name of the young man or woman who first entered the door after the
          kail was in position would be the baptismal name of the husband or
          wife.<a id="noteref_599" name="noteref_599" href=

          Again, young women sowed hemp seed over nine ridges of ploughed
          land, saying, <span class="tei tei-q">“I sow hemp seed, and he who
          is to be my husband, let him come and harrow it.”</span> On looking
          back over her left shoulder the girl would see the figure of her
          future mate behind her in the darkness. In the north-east of
          Scotland lint seed was used instead of hemp seed and answered the
          purpose quite as well.<a id="noteref_600" name="noteref_600" href=

          Again, a mode of ascertaining your future husband or wife was this.
          Take a clue of blue yarn and go to a lime-kiln. Throw the clue into
          the kiln, but keep one end of the thread in your hand and wind it
          on to another clue. As you come near the end somebody or something
          will hold the other end tight in the kiln. Then you call out,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Who holds?”</span> giving the thread at
          the same time a gentle pull. Some one or something will thereupon
          pull the other end of the thread, and a voice will mention the name
          of your future husband or wife.<a id="noteref_601" name=

          Another way is this. Go to the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          doors and if possible take them off their hinges; for if the being
          who is about to appear should catch you in the barn and clap the
          doors to on you, he or she might do you a mischief. Having done
          this, take the sieve or winnowing-basket, which in Lowland Scotch
          is called a <span lang="gd" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=

          action of winnowing corn. Repeat it thrice, and at the third time
          the apparition of your future husband or wife will pass through the

          this. Go to a southward running stream, where the lands of three
          lairds meet, or to a ford where the dead and living have crossed.
          Dip the left sleeve of your shirt in the water. Then go home, take
          off the shirt, hang it up before a fire to dry, and go to bed,
          taking care that the bed stands so that you can see your shirt
          hanging before the fire. Keep awake, and at midnight you will see
          the form of your future spouse come into the room and turn the
          other side of the sleeve to the fire to dry it.<a id="noteref_603"

          Highland form of divination at Hallowe'en is to take a shoe by the

          from the length of time they burned and the brightness of the flame
          the length and happiness of the married life of the two were
          augured. But if instead of burning together one of the nuts leaped
          away from the other, then there would be no marriage, and the blame

          Again, three plates or basins were placed on the hearth. One was
          filled with clean water, another with dirty water, and the third
          was empty. The enquirer was blindfolded, knelt in front of the
          hearth, and groped about till he put his finger in one of them. If
          he lighted on the plate with the clean water, he would wed a maid;

          the dirty water, he would marry a widow; and if on the empty plate,
          he would remain a bachelor. For a girl the answer of the oracle was
          analogous; she would marry a bachelor, a widower, or nobody
          according to the plate into which she chanced to dip her finger.
          But to make sure, the operation had to be repeated thrice, the
          position of the plates being changed each time. If the enquirer put
          his or her finger into the same plate thrice or even twice, it was
          quite conclusive.<a id="noteref_610" name="noteref_610" href=

          looking-glass. Then you sliced the apple, stuck each slice on the

          looked into the glass and combed your hair. The spectre of your

          marked. Then having said their prayers round the fire, they went to

          According to Sir John Rhys, the habit of celebrating Hallowe'en by
          lighting bonfires on the hills is perhaps not yet extinct in Wales,
          and men still living <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page240">[pg
          240]</span><a name="Pg240" id="Pg240" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          can remember how the people who assisted at the bonfires would wait
          till the last spark was out and then would suddenly take to their
          heels, shouting at the top of their voices, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“The cropped black sow seize the hindmost!”</span> The
          saying, as Sir John Rhys justly remarks, implies that originally
          one of the company became a victim in dead earnest. Down to the
          present time the saying is current in Carnarvonshire, where
          allusions to the cutty black sow are still occasionally made to
          frighten children.<a id="noteref_616" name="noteref_616" href=

          of life and death have at one time or other been drawn from the
          position and state of the pebbles on the morning of All Saints'
          Day. The custom, thus found among three separate branches of the
          Celtic stock, probably dates from a period before their dispersion,
          or at least from a time when alien races had not yet driven home
          the wedges of separation between them.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In Wales, as in
          Scotland, Hallowe'en was also the great season for forecasting the
          future in respect of love and marriage, and some of the forms of
          divination employed for this purpose resembled those which were in
          use among the Scotch peasantry. Two girls, for example, would make
          a little ladder of yarn, without breaking it from the ball, and
          having done so they would throw it out of the window. Then one of
          the girls, holding the ball in her hand, would wind the yarn back,
          repeating a rhyme in Welsh. This she did thrice, and as she wound
          the yarn she would see her future husband climbing up the little
          ladder. Again, three bowls or basins were placed on a table. One of
          them contained clean water, one dirty water, and one was empty. The
          girls of the household, and sometimes the boys too, then eagerly
          tried their fortunes. They were blindfolded, led up to the table,
          and dipped their hands into a bowl. If they happened to dip into
          the clean water, they would marry maidens or bachelors; if into the
          dirty water, they would be widowers or widows; if into the empty
          bowl, they would <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page241">[pg
          241]</span><a name="Pg241" id="Pg241" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          live unmarried. Again, if a girl, walking backwards, would place a
          knife among the leeks on Hallowe'en, she would see her future
          husband come and pick up the knife and throw it into the middle of
          the garden.<a id="noteref_619" name="noteref_619" href=

          Hallowe'en bonfires would seem to have died out, but the Hallowe'en
          divination has survived. Writing towards the end of the eighteenth
          century, General Vallancey tells us that on Hallowe'en or the vigil
          of Saman, as he calls it, <span class="tei tei-q">“the peasants in
          Ireland assemble with sticks and clubs (the emblems of laceration)
          going from house to house, collecting money, bread-cake, butter,
          cheese, eggs, etc., etc., for the feast, repeating verses in honour
          of the solemnity, demanding preparations for the festival, in the
          name of St. Columb Kill, desiring them to lay aside the fatted
          calf, and to bring forth the black sheep. The good women are
          employed in making the griddle cake and candles; these last are
          sent from house to house in the vicinity, and are lighted up on the
          (Saman) next day, before which they pray, or are supposed to pray,
          for the departed souls of the donor. Every house abounds in the
          best viands they can afford: apples and nuts are devoured in
          abundance: the nut-shells are burnt, and from the ashes many
          strange things are foretold: cabbages are torn up by the root: hemp
          seed is sown by the maidens, and they believe, that if they look
          back, they will see the apparition of the man intended for their
          future spouse: they hang a smock before the fire, on the close of
          the feast, and sit up all night, concealed in a corner of the room,
          convinced that his apparition will come down the chimney and turn
          the smock: they throw a ball of yarn out of the window, and wind it
          on the reel within, convinced, that if they repeat the <span lang=
          "la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Pater Noster</span></span> backwards, and look
          at the ball of yarn without, they will then also see his
          <span lang="ga" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="ga"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">sith</span></span> or apparition: they dip for
          apples in a tub of water, and endeavour to bring one up in the
          mouth: they suspend a cord with a cross-stick, with apples at one
          point, and candles lighted at the other, and endeavour to catch the
          apple, while it is in a circular motion, in the mouth. These, and
          many other superstitious ceremonies, the remains of Druidism, are

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In Queen's
          County, Ireland, down to the latter part of the nineteenth century
          children practised various of these rites of divination on
          Hallowe'en. Girls went out into the garden blindfold and pulled up
          cabbages: if the cabbage was well grown, the girl would have a
          handsome husband, but if it had a crooked stalk, the future spouse
          would be a stingy old man. Nuts, again, were placed in pairs on the
          bar of the fire, and from their behaviour omens were drawn of the
          fate in love and marriage of the couple whom they represented.
          Lead, also, was melted and allowed to drop into a tub of cold
          water, and from the shapes which it assumed in the water
          predictions were made to the children of their future destiny.
          Again, apples were bobbed for in a tub of water and brought up with
          the teeth; or a stick was hung from a hook with an apple at one end
          and a candle at the other, and the stick being made to revolve you
          made a bite at the apple and sometimes got a mouthful of candle
          instead.<a id="noteref_621" name="noteref_621" href=
          "#note_621"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">621</span></span></a> In
          County Leitrim, also, down to near the end of the nineteenth
          century various forms of divination were practised at Hallowe'en.
          Girls ascertained the character of their future husbands by the
          help of cabbages just as in Queen's County. Again, if a girl found
          a branch of a briar-thorn which had bent over and grown into the
          ground so as to form a loop, she would creep through the loop
          thrice late in the evening in the devil's name, then cut the briar
          and put it under her pillow, all without speaking a word. Then she
          would lay her head on the pillow and dream of the man she was to
          marry. Boys, also, would dream in like manner of love and marriage
          at Hallowe'en, if only they would gather ten leaves of ivy without
          speaking, throw away one, and put the other nine under their
          pillow. Again, divination was practised by means of a cake called
          <span lang="ga" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="ga"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">barm-breac</span></span>, in which a nut and a
          ring were baked. Whoever got the ring would be married first;
          whoever got the nut would marry a widow or a widower; but if the
          nut were an empty shell, he or she <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page243">[pg 243]</span><a name="Pg243" id="Pg243" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> would remain unwed. Again, a girl would take
          a clue of worsted, go to a lime kiln in the gloaming, and throw the
          clew into the kiln in the devil's name, while she held fast the
          other end of the thread. Then she would rewind the thread and ask,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Who holds my clue?”</span> and the name of
          her future husband would come up from the depth of the kiln.
          Another way was to take a rake, go to a rick and walk round it nine
          times, saying, <span class="tei tei-q">“I rake this rick in the
          devil's name.”</span> At the ninth time the wraith of your destined
          partner for life would come and take the rake out of your hand.
          Once more, before the company separated for the night, they would
          rake the ashes smooth on the hearth, and search them next morning
          for tracks, from which they judged whether anybody should come to
          the house, or leave it, or die in it before another year was
          out.<a id="noteref_622" name="noteref_622" href=
          "#note_622"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">622</span></span></a> In
          County Roscommon, which borders on County Leitrim, a cake is made
          in nearly every house on Hallowe'en, and a ring, a coin, a sloe,
          and a chip of wood are put into it. Whoever gets the coin will be
          rich; whoever gets the ring will be married first; whoever gets the
          chip of wood, which stands for a coffin, will die first; and
          whoever gets the sloe will live longest, because the fairies blight
          the sloes in the hedges on Hallowe'en, so that the sloe in the cake
          will be the last of the year. Again, on the same mystic evening
          girls take nine grains of oats in their mouths, and going out
          without speaking walk about till they hear a man's name pronounced;
          it will be the name of their future husband. In County Roscommon,
          too, on Hallowe'en there is the usual dipping in water for apples
          or sixpences, and the usual bites at a revolving apple and tallow
          candle.<a id="noteref_623" name="noteref_623" href=

          <span class="tei tei-q">“This is Hollantide Eve.”</span> For
          Hollantide is the Manx way of expressing the old English <em class=

          But as the people reckon this festival according to the Old Style,
          Hollantide in the Isle of Man is our twelfth of November. The
          native Manx name for the day is <span lang="gv" class=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">624</span></span></a> Here,
          too, as in Scotland forms of divination are practised by some
          people on this important evening. For example, the housewife fills
          a thimble full of salt for each member of the family and each
          guest; the contents of the thimblefuls are emptied out in as many
          neat little piles on a plate, and left there over night. Next
          morning the piles are examined, and if any of them has fallen down,
          he or she whom it represents will die within the year. Again, the
          women carefully sweep out the ashes from under the fireplace and
          flatten them down neatly on the open hearth. If they find next
          morning a footprint turned towards the door, it signifies a death
          in the family within the year; but if the footprint is turned in
          the opposite direction, it bodes a marriage. Again, divination by
          eavesdropping is practised in the Isle of Man in much the same way
          as in Scotland. You go out with your mouth full of water and your
          hands full of salt and listen at a neighbour's door, and the first
          name you hear will be the name of your husband. Again, Manx maids
          bandage their eyes and grope about the room till they dip their
          hands in vessels full of clean or dirty water, and so on; and from
          the thing they touch they draw corresponding omens. But some people
          in the Isle of Man observe these auguries, not on Hallowe'en or
          Hollantide Eve, as they call it, which was the old Manx New Year's
          Eve, but on the modern New Year's Eve, that is, on the thirty-first
          of December. The change no doubt marks a transition from the
          ancient to the modern mode of dating the beginning of the
          year.<a id="noteref_625" name="noteref_625" href=

          Again, witches in Lancashire used to gather on Hallowe'en at the
          Malkin Tower, a ruined and desolate farm-house in the forest of
          Pendle. They assembled for no good purpose; but you could keep the
          infernal rout at bay by carrying a lighted candle about the fells
          from eleven to twelve o'clock at night. The witches tried to blow
          out the candle, and if they succeeded, so much the worse for you;
          but if the flame burned steadily till the clocks had struck
          midnight, you were safe. Some people performed the ceremony by
          deputy; and parties went about from house to house in the evening
          collecting candles, one for each inmate, and offering their
          services to <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If the heathen
          of ancient Europe celebrated, as we have good reason to believe,
          the season of Midsummer with a great festival of fire, of which the
          traces have survived in many places down to our own time, it is
          natural to suppose that they should have observed with similar
          rites the corresponding season of Midwinter; for Midsummer and
          Midwinter, or, in more technical language, the summer solstice and
          the winter solstice, are the two great turning-points in the sun's
          apparent course through the sky, and from the standpoint of
          primitive man nothing might seem more appropriate than to kindle
          fires on earth at the two moments when the fire and heat of the
          great luminary in heaven begin to wane or to wax. In this way the
          savage philosopher, to whose meditations on the nature of things we
          owe many ancient customs and ceremonies, might easily imagine that
          he helped the labouring sun to relight his dying lamp, or at all
          events to blow up the flame into a brighter blaze. Certain it is
          that the winter solstice, which the ancients erroneously assigned
          to the twenty-fifth of December, was celebrated in antiquity as the
          Birthday of the Sun, and that festal lights or fires were kindled
          on this joyful occasion. Our Christmas festival is nothing but a
          continuation under a Christian name of this old solar festivity;
          for the ecclesiastical authorities saw fit, about the end of the
          third or the beginning of the fourth century, arbitrarily to
          transfer the nativity of Christ from the sixth of January to the
          twenty-fifth of December, for the purpose of diverting to their
          Lord the worship which the heathen had hitherto paid on that day to
          the sun.<a id="noteref_631" name="noteref_631" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In modern
          Christendom the ancient fire-festival of the winter solstice
          appears to survive, or to have survived down to recent years, in
          the old custom of the Yule log, clog, or block, as it was variously
          called in England.<a id="noteref_632" name="noteref_632" href=
          "#note_632"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">632</span></span></a> The
          custom was widespread in Europe, but seems to have flourished
          especially in England, France, and among the South Slavs; at least
          the fullest accounts of the custom come from these quarters. That
          the Yule log was only the winter counterpart of the Midsummer
          bonfire, kindled within doors instead of in the open air on account
          of the cold and inclement weather of the season, was pointed out
          long ago by our English antiquary John Brand;<a id="noteref_633"
          name="noteref_633" href="#note_633"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">633</span></span></a> and
          the view is supported by the many quaint superstitions attaching to
          the Yule log, superstitions which have no apparent connexion with
          Christianity but carry their heathen origin plainly stamped upon
          them. But while the two solstitial celebrations were both festivals
          of fire, the necessity or desirability of holding the winter
          celebration within doors lent it the character of a private or
          domestic festivity, which contrasts strongly with the publicity of
          the summer celebration, at which the people gathered on some open
          space or conspicuous height, kindled a huge bonfire in common, and
          danced and made merry round it together.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Among the
          Germans the custom of the Yule log is known to have been observed
          in the eleventh century; for in the year 1184 the parish priest of
          Ahlen, in Münsterland, spoke of <span class="tei tei-q">“bringing a
          tree to kindle the festal fire at the Lord's
          Nativity.”</span><a id="noteref_634" name="noteref_634" href=

          to about the middle of the nineteenth century the old rite was kept
          up in some parts of central Germany, as we learn from an account of
          it given by a contemporary writer. After mentioning the custom of
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page248">[pg 248]</span><a name=
          "Pg248" id="Pg248" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> feeding the cattle
          and shaking the fruit-trees on Christmas night, to make them bear
          fruit, he goes on as follows: <span class="tei tei-q">“Other
          customs pointing back to the far-off times of heathendom may still
          be met with among the old-fashioned peasants of the mountain
          regions. Such is in the valleys of the Sieg and Lahn the practice
          of laying a new log as a foundation of the hearth. A heavy block of
          oak-wood, generally a stump grubbed up from the ground, is fitted
          either into the floor of the hearth, or into a niche made for the
          purpose in the wall under the hook on which the kettle hangs. When
          the fire on the hearth glows, this block of wood glows too, but it
          is so placed that it is hardly reduced to ashes within a year. When
          the new foundation is laid, the remains of the old block are
          carefully taken out, ground to powder, and strewed over the fields
          during the Twelve Nights. This, so people fancied, promotes the
          fruitfulness of the year's crops.”</span><a id="noteref_635" name=

          <span class="tei tei-q">“The Yule log plays a great part at the
          festival of the winter solstice in Perigord. The countryman thinks
          that it is best made of plum-tree, cherry, or oak, and <span class=

          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> that the larger it is the better. If it
          burns well, it is a good omen, the blessing of heaven rests upon
          it. The charcoal and ashes, which are collected very carefully, are
          excellent for healing swollen glands; the part of the trunk which
          has not been burnt in the fire is used by ploughmen to make the
          wedge (<span lang="fr" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
          "fr"><span style="font-style: italic">técoin ou cale</span></span>)
          for their plough, because they allege that it causes the seeds to
          thrive better; and the women keep pieces of it till Twelfth Night
          for the sake of their chickens. Nevertheless if you sit down on the
          log, you become subject to boils, and to cure yourself of them you
          must pass nine times under a bramble branch which happens to be
          rooted in the ground at both ends. The charcoal heals sheep of a
          disease called the <span lang="fr" class="tei tei-foreign"

          wrapt up in white linen, preserve the whole household from
          accidents. Some people think that they will have as many chickens
          as there are sparks that fly out of the brands of the log when they
          shake them; and others place the extinct brands under the bed to
          drive away vermin. In Vienne, on Christmas Eve, when supper is
          over, the master of the house has a great log—the Christmas
          brand—brought in, and then, surrounded by all the spectators
          gathered in profound silence, he sprinkles salt and water on the
          log. It is then put on the fire to burn during the three festivals;
          but they carefully preserve a piece to be kindled every time that
          it thunders.”</span><a id="noteref_645" name="noteref_645" href=

          Berry, a district of Central France, the Yule log was called the
          <span lang="fr" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="fr"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">cosse de Nau</span></span>, the last word
          being an abbreviation of the usual French word for Christmas
          (Noël). It consisted of an enormous tree-trunk, so heavy that the
          united strength of several men was needed to carry it in and place
          it on the hearth, where it served to feed the fire during the three
          days of the Christmas festivity. Strictly speaking, it should be
          the trunk of an old oak-tree which had never been lopped and had
          been felled at midnight. It <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          the tinkle of the bell announced the elevation of the host at the
          midnight mass; and the head of the family, after sprinkling it with
          holy water, set it on fire. The remains of the log were preserved
          till the same day next year. They were kept under the bed of the
          master of the house; and whenever thunder was heard, one of the
          family would take a piece of the log and throw it on the fire,
          which was believed to guard the family against lightning. In the
          Middle Ages, we are told, several fiefs were granted on condition
          that the vassal should bring in person a Yule log every year for
          the hearth of his liege lord.<a id="noteref_646" name="noteref_646"

          and beliefs survived till recent years in some of the remote
          country villages of the picturesque district known as the Bocage of
          Normandy. There it was the grandfather or other oldest man of the
          family who chose the Yule log in good time and had it ready for
          Christmas Eve. Then he placed it on the hearth at the moment when
          the church bell began to ring for the evening service. Kneeling
          reverently at the hearth with the members of his family in a like
          attitude of devotion, the old man recited three <span lang="la"

          of heaven on the log and on the cottage. Then at the sound of the
          bell which proclaimed the sacrament of the mass, or, if the church
          was too far off to allow the tinkle of the bell to be heard, at the
          moment when they judged that the priest was elevating the host
          before the high altar, the patriarch sprinkled the burning log with
          holy water, blessed it in the name of the Father and of the Son and
          of the Holy Ghost, and drew it out of the fire. The charred log was
          then carefully kept till the following Christmas as a precious
          relic which would guard the house against the levin bolt, evil
          spirits, sorcerers, and every misfortune that might befall in the

          fragments and keep them as valuable talismans to guard them against
          the stroke of lightning. At Vagney and other places near it in the
          Vosges it used to be customary on the same evening to grease the
          hinges and the latches of the doors, that no harsh grating sound
          should break the slumbers of the infant Christ. In the Vosges
          Mountains, too, as indeed in many other places, cattle acquired the

          Eve, says the antiquary John Brand, <span class="tei tei-q">“our
          ancestors were wont to light up candles of an uncommon size, called
          Christmas Candles, and lay a log of wood upon the fire, called a
          Yule-clog or Christmas-block, to illuminate the house, and, as it
          were, to turn night into day. This custom is, in some measure,
          still kept up in the North of England. In the buttery of St. John's
          College, Oxford, an ancient candle-socket of stone still remains
          ornamented with the figure of the Holy Lamb. It was formerly used
          to burn the Christmas Candle in, on the high table at supper,

          <span class="tei tei-q">“A tall mould candle, called a Yule candle,
          is lighted and set on the table; these candles are presented by the
          chandlers and grocers to their customers. The Yule-log is bought of
          the carpenters' lads. It would be unlucky to light either of them
          before the time, or to stir the fire or candle during the supper;
          the candle must not be snuffed, neither must any one stir from the
          table till supper is ended. In these suppers it is considered
          unlucky to have an odd number at table. A fragment of the log is
          occasionally saved, and put under a bed, to remain till next
          Christmas: it secures the house from fire; a small piece of it
          thrown into a fire occurring at the house of a neighbour, will
          quell the raging flame. A piece of the candle should likewise be

          the seventeenth century, as we learn from some verses of Herrick,
          the English custom was to light the Yule log with a fragment of its
          predecessor, which had been kept throughout the year for the
          purpose; where it was so kept, the fiend could do no

          Whitby the portions so kept were stowed away under the bed till
          next Christmas, when they were burnt with the new log; in the

          late as 1830, or thereabout, the scene of lighting the hearth-fire
          on Christmas Eve, to continue burning throughout the Christmas
          season, might have been witnessed in the secluded and beautiful
          hill-country of West Shropshire, from Chirbury and Worthen to
          Pulverbatch and Pontesbury. The Christmas brand or brund, as they
          called it, was a great trunk of seasoned oak, holly, yew, or
          crab-tree, drawn by horses to the farm-house door and thence rolled
          by means of rollers and levers to the back of the wide open hearth,
          where the fire was made up in front of it. The embers were raked up
          to it every night, and it was carefully tended, that it might not
          go out during the whole Christmas season. All those days no light
          might be struck, given, or borrowed. Such was the custom at Worthen
          in the early part of the nineteenth century.<a id="noteref_667"

          with sprigs of holly and ivy, which must not be brought in until
          Christmas Eve. A Yule log, as large as the open hearth could
          accommodate, was brought into the kitchen of each farmhouse, and
          smaller ones were used in the cottages. W—— P—— said he had seen a
          tree drawn into the kitchen at Kingstone Grange years ago by two
          cart horses; when it had been consumed a small portion was
          carefully kept to be used for lighting next year's log.
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘Mother always kept it very carefully; she
          said it was lucky, and kept the house from fire and from

          sends two of its strongest young men to the nearest forest to cut
          down a young oak tree and bring it home. There, after offering up a
          short prayer or crossing themselves thrice, they throw a handful of
          wheat on the chosen oak and greet it with the words, <span class=

          shall fall towards the east at the moment when the sun's orb
          appears over the rim of the eastern horizon. Should the tree fall
          towards the west, it would be the worst possible omen for the house
          and its inmates in the ensuing year; and it is also an evil omen if
          the tree should be caught and stopped in its fall by another tree.

          to keep and carry home the first chip from the fallen oak. The
          trunk is sawn into two or three logs, one of them rather longer
          than the others. A flat, unleavened cake of the purest wheaten
          flour is brought out of the house and broken on the larger of the
          logs by a woman. The logs are left for the present to stand

          another glass of red wine is poured on the log. Then the oldest

          people. Then he walks straight to the hearth, <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page262">[pg 262]</span><a name="Pg262" id="Pg262"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> takes a shovel and strikes the burning
          log so that a cloud of sparks flies up the chimney, while he says,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“May you have this year so many oxen, so
          many horses, so many sheep, so many pigs, so many beehives full of
          honey, so much good luck, prosperity, progress, and
          happiness!”</span> Having uttered these good wishes, he embraces
          and kisses his host. Then he turns again to the hearth, and after
          crossing himself falls on his knees and kisses the projecting part
          of the Yule log. On rising to his feet he places a coin on the log
          as his gift. Meanwhile a low wooden chair has been brought in by a
          woman, and the visiter is led to it to take his seat. But just as
          he is about to do so, the chair is jerked away from under him by a
          male member of the family and he measures his length on the floor.
          By this fall he is supposed to fix into the ground all the good
          wishes which he has uttered that morning. The hostess thereupon
          wraps him in a thick blanket, and he sits quietly muffled in it for
          a few minutes; the thick blanket in which he is swathed is
          believed, on the principles of homoeopathic magic, to ensure that
          the cows will give thick cream the next year. While he sits thus
          enriching the milk of the dairy, the lads who are to herd the sheep
          in the coming year go to the hearth and kneeling down before it
          kiss each other across the projecting end of the Yule log. By this
          demonstration of affection they are thought to seal the love of the
          ewes for their lambs.<a id="noteref_671" name="noteref_671" href=

          the Yule log is observed in a similar form by the Servians who
          inhabit the southern provinces of Austria. Thus in Syrmia, a
          district of Slavonia which borders on Servia, the head of the house
          sends out one or two young men on Christmas Eve to cut the Yule log
          in the nearest forest. On being brought in, the log is not mixed
          with the ordinary fuel but placed by itself, generally leaning
          against a fruit-tree till the evening shadows begin to fall. When a
          man carries it into the kitchen and lays it on the fire, the master
          of the house throws corn over him, and the two greet each other
          solemnly, the one saying, <span class="tei tei-q">“Christ is
          born,”</span> and the other answering, <span class="tei tei-q">“He
          is born indeed.”</span> Later in the evening the master of
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page263">[pg 263]</span><a name=
          "Pg263" id="Pg263" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the house pours a
          glass of wine on the charred end of the log, whereupon one of the
          younger men takes the burnt piece of wood, carries it to the
          orchard, and sets it up against one of the fruit-trees. For this
          service he is rewarded by the master of the house with a piece of
          money. On Christmas Day, when the family is assembled at table,
          they expect the arrival of the special Christmas visiter (called
          <span lang="sr" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sr"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">polazenik</span></span>), the only person who
          is allowed to enter the house that day. When he comes, he goes to
          the hearth, stirs the fire with the poker and says, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Christ is born. May the family enjoy all good luck and
          happiness in this year! May the cattle increase in number like the
          sparks I have struck!”</span> As he says these words, the mistress
          of the house pours corn over him and leads him to the parlour,
          where he takes the place of honour beside the master of the house.
          He is treated with marked attention and respect. The family are at
          pains to entertain him; they sing their best songs for his
          amusement, and after midnight a numerous band of men and maidens
          escorts him by torchlight, with songs and jubilation, to his own
          house.<a id="noteref_672" name="noteref_672" href=

          symbol of family luck. It is generally cut from an evergreen oak,
          but sometimes from an olive-tree or a beech. At nightfall the
          master of the house himself brings in the log and lays it on the
          fire. Then he and all present bare their heads, sprinkle the log
          with wine, and make a cross on it. After that the master of the
          house says, <span class="tei tei-q">“Welcome, O log! May God keep
          you from mishap!”</span> So saying he strews peas, maize, raisins,
          and wheat on the log, praying for God's blessing on all members of
          the family living and dead, for heaven's blessing on their
          undertakings, and for domestic prosperity. In Montenegro they meet
          the log with a loaf of bread and a jug of wine, drink to it, and
          pour wine on it, whereupon the whole family drinks out of the same
          beaker. In Dalmatia and other places, for example in Rizano, the
          Yule logs are decked by young women with red silk, flowers,
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page264">[pg 264]</span><a name=

          ribbons, and even gold wire; and the lights near the doorposts are
          kindled when the log is brought into the house. Among the Morlaks,
          as soon as the master of the house crosses the threshold with the
          Yule log, one of the family must sprinkle corn on him and say,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“God bless you,”</span> to which he
          answers, <span class="tei tei-q">“The same to you.”</span> A piece
          of the log is kept till New Year's Day to kindle a light with or it
          is carried out to the fields to protect them from hail. It is
          customary to invite before hand a Christmas visiter (<span lang=
          "sr" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sr"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">polažaynik</span></span>) and to admit no one
          else into the house on that day. He comes early, carrying in his
          sleeves a quantity of corn which he throws into the house, saying,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Christ is born.”</span> One of the
          household replies, <span class="tei tei-q">“He is born
          indeed,”</span> and throws corn on the visiter. Then the newcomer
          goes up to the hearth, pokes the fire and strikes the burning log
          with the poker so hard that sparks fly off in all directions. At
          each blow he says, <span class="tei tei-q">“I wish the family as
          many cows, calves, sucking pigs, goats, and sheep, and as many
          strokes of good luck, as the sparks that now fly from the

          fire-festival at midwinter. The public celebration of such rites at
          that season of the year appears to have been rare and exceptional
          in Central and Northern Europe. However, some instances are on
          record. Thus at Schweina, in Thuringia, down to the second half of
          the nineteenth century, the young people used to kindle a great
          bonfire on the Antonius Mountain every year on Christmas Eve.
          Neither the civil nor the ecclesiastical authorities were able to
          suppress the celebration; nor could the cold, rain, and snow of the
          season damp or chill the enthusiasm of the celebrants. For some
          time before Christmas the young men and boys were busy building a
          foundation for the bonfire on the top of the mountain, where the
          oldest church of the village used to stand. The foundation
          consisted of a pyramidal structure composed of stones, turf, and
          moss. When Christmas Eve came round, a strong pole, with bundles of
          brushwood tied to it, was erected on the pyramid. The young folk
          also provided themselves with poles to which old brooms or faggots
          of shavings were attached. These were to serve as torches. When the
          evening grew dark and the church bells rang to service, the troop
          of lads ascended the mountain; and soon from the top the glare of
          the bonfire lit up the darkness, and the sound of a hymn broke the
          stillness of night. In a circle round the great fire lesser fires
          were kindled; and last of all the lads ran about swinging their
          lighted torches, till these twinkling points of fire, moving down
          the mountain-side, went out one by one in the darkness. At midnight
          the bells rang out from the church <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          the sound of singing. Feasting and revelry were kept up throughout
          the night, and in the morning young and old went to early mass to
          be edified by hearing of the light eternal.<a id="noteref_680"

          Burghead, an ancient village on the southern shore of the Moray
          Firth, about nine miles from the town of Elgin, a festival of fire
          called <span class="tei tei-q">“the Burning of the Clavie”</span>
          has been celebrated from time immemorial on Hogmanay, the last day
          of December. A tar-barrel is sawn in two, one half of it is set on
          the top of a stout pole, and filled with tar and other
          combustibles. The half-barrel is fastened to the pole by means of a
          long nail, which is made for the purpose and furnished gratuitously
          by the village blacksmith. The nail must be knocked in with a
          stone; the use of a hammer is forbidden. When the shades of evening
          have begun to fall, the Clavie, as it is called, is set on fire by
          means of a burning peat, which is always fetched from the same
          house; it may not be kindled with a match. As soon as it is in a
          blaze, it is shouldered by a man, who proceeds to carry it at a
          run, flaring and dripping melted tar, round the old <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page267">[pg 267]</span><a name="Pg267" id="Pg267"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> boundaries of the village; the modern
          part of the town is not included in the circuit. Close at his heels
          follows a motley crowd, cheering and shouting. One bearer relieves
          another as each wearies of his burden. The first to shoulder the
          Clavie, which is esteemed an honour, is usually a man who has been
          lately married. Should the bearer stumble or fall, it is deemed a
          very ill omen for him and for the village. In bygone times it was
          thought necessary that one man should carry it all round the
          village; hence the strongest man was chosen for the purpose.
          Moreover it was customary to carry the burning Clavie round every
          fishing-boat and vessel in the harbour; but this part of the
          ceremony was afterwards discontinued. Finally, the blazing
          tar-barrel is borne to a small hill called the Doorie, which rises
          near the northern end of the promontory. Here the pole is fixed
          into a socket in a pillar of freestone, and fresh fuel is heaped
          upon the flames, which flare up higher and brighter than ever.
          Formerly the Clavie was allowed to burn here the whole night, but
          now, after blazing for about half an hour, it is lifted from the
          socket and thrown down the western slope of the hill. Then the
          crowd rushes upon it, demolishes it, and scrambles for the burning,
          smoking embers, which they carry home and carefully preserve as
          charms to protect them against witchcraft and misfortune.<a id=

          great antiquity of Burghead, where this curious and no doubt
          ancient festival is still annually observed, appears from the
          remains of a very remarkable rampart which formerly encircled the
          place. It consists of a mound of earth faced on both sides with a
          solid wall of stone and strengthened internally by oak beams and
          planks, the whole being laid on a foundation of boulders. The style
          of the rampart agrees in general with Caesar's description of the
          mode in which the Gauls constructed their walls of earth, stone,
          and logs,<a id="noteref_684" name="noteref_684" href=

          it resembles the ruins of Gallic fortifications which have been

          in France, though it is said to surpass them in the strength and
          solidity of its structure. No similar walls appear to be known in
          Britain. A great part of this interesting prehistoric fortress was
          barbarously destroyed in the early part of the nineteenth century,
          much of it being tumbled into the sea and many of the stones used
          to build the harbour piers.<a id="noteref_685" name="noteref_685"

          on our attention because they may perhaps be regarded as the source
          and origin of all the other fire-festivals; certainly they must
          date from a very remote antiquity. The general name by which they
          are known among the Teutonic peoples is need-fire.<a id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The history of
          the need-fire can be traced back to the early Middle Ages; for in
          the reign of Pippin, King of the Franks, the practice of kindling
          need-fires was denounced as a heathen superstition by a synod of
          prelates and nobles held under the presidency of Boniface,
          Archbishop of Mainz.<a id="noteref_689" name="noteref_689" href=

          Observances,”</span> which has been usually referred to the year
          743 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span>, though some scholars
          assign it a later date under the reign of Charlemagne.<a id=

          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">690</span></span></a> In
          Germany the need-fires would seem to have been popular down to the
          second half of the nineteenth century. Thus in the year 1598, when
          a fatal cattle-plague was raging at Neustadt, near Marburg, a wise
          man of the name of Joh. Köhler induced the authorities of the town
          to adopt the following remedy. A new waggon-wheel was taken and
          twirled round an axle, which had never been used before, until the
          friction elicited fire. With this fire a bonfire was next kindled
          between the gates of the town, and all the cattle were driven
          through the smoke and flames. Moreover, every householder had to
          rekindle the fire on his hearth by means of a light taken from the
          bonfire. Strange to say, this salutary measure had no effect
          whatever in staying the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page271">[pg
          271]</span><a name="Pg271" id="Pg271" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          cattle-plague, and seven years later the sapient Joh. Köhler
          himself was burnt as a witch. The farmers, whose pigs and cows had
          derived no benefit from the need-fire, perhaps assisted as
          spectators at the burning, and, while they shook their heads,
          agreed among themselves that it served Joh. Köhler perfectly
          right.<a id="noteref_691" name="noteref_691" href=

          According to a writer who published his book about nine years
          afterwards, some of the Germans, especially in the Wassgaw
          mountains, confidently believed that a cattle-plague could be
          stayed by driving the animals through a need-fire which had been
          kindled by the violent friction of a pole on a quantity of dry oak
          wood; but it was a necessary condition of success that all fires in
          the village should previously be extinguished with water, and any
          householder who failed to put out his fire was heavily fined.<a id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The method of
          kindling the need-fire is described as follows by a writer towards
          the end of the seventeenth century: <span class="tei tei-q">“When
          an evil plague has broken out among the cattle, large and small,
          and the herds have thereby suffered great ravages, the peasants
          resolve to light a need-fire. On a day appointed there must be no
          single flame in any house nor on any hearth. From every house a
          quantity of straw and water and underwood must be brought forth;
          then a strong oaken pole is fixed firmly in the earth, a hole is
          bored in it, and a wooden winch, well smeared with pitch and tar,
          is inserted in the hole and turned round forcibly till great heat
          and then fire is generated. The fire so produced is caught in fuel
          and fed with straw, heath, and underwood till it bursts out into a
          regular need-fire, which must then be somewhat spread out between
          walls or fences, and the cattle and horses driven through it twice
          or thrice with sticks and whips. Others set up two posts, each with
          a hole in it, and insert a winch, along with old greasy rags, in
          the holes. Others use a thick rope, collect nine kinds of wood, and
          keep them in violent motion till fire leaps forth. Perhaps there
          may be other <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page272">[pg
          272]</span><a name="Pg272" id="Pg272" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          ways of generating or kindling this fire, but they are all directed
          simply at the cure of the cattle. After passing twice or thrice
          through the fire the cattle are driven to their stalls or to
          pasture, and the heap of wood that had been collected is destroyed,
          but in some places every householder must take with him a brand,
          extinguish it in a washing-tub or trough, and put it in the manger
          where the cattle are fed, where it must lie for some time. The
          poles that were used to make the need-fire, together with the wood
          that was employed as a winch, are sometimes burned with the rest of
          the fuel, sometimes carefully preserved after the cattle have been
          thrice driven through the flames.”</span><a id="noteref_693" name=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Sometimes the
          need-fire was known as the <span class="tei tei-q">“wild
          fire,”</span> to distinguish it no doubt from the tame fire
          produced by more ordinary methods. The following is Grimm's account
          of the mode of kindling it which prevailed in some parts of Central
          Germany, particularly about Hildesheim, down apparently to the
          first half of the nineteenth century: <span class="tei tei-q">“In
          many places of Lower Saxony, especially among the mountains, the
          custom prevails of preparing the so-called <span class=
          "tei tei-q">‘wild fire’</span> for the purpose of preventing
          cattle-plague; and through it first the pigs, then the cows, and
          last of all the geese are driven. The proceedings on the occasion
          are as follows. The principal farmers and parishioners assemble,
          and notice is served to every inhabitant to extinguish entirely all
          fire in his house, so that not even a spark remains alight in the
          whole village. Then young and old repair to a road in a hollow,
          usually towards evening, the women carrying linen, and the men wood
          and tow. Two oaken poles are driven into the ground about a foot
          and a half from each other. Each pole has in the side facing the
          other a socket into which a cross-piece as thick as a man's arm is
          fitted. The sockets are stuffed with linen, and the cross-piece is
          rammed in as tight as possible, while the poles are bound together
          at the top by ropes. A rope is wound about the round, smooth
          cross-piece, and the free ends of the rope at both sides are
          gripped by several <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page273">[pg
          273]</span><a name="Pg273" id="Pg273" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          persons, who pull the cross-piece to and fro with the utmost
          rapidity, till through the friction the linen in the sockets takes
          fire. The sparks of the linen are immediately caught in tow or
          oakum and waved about in a circle until they burst into a bright
          glow, when straw is applied to it, and the flaming straw used to
          kindle the brushwood which has been stacked in piles in the hollow
          way. When this wood has blazed up and the fire has nearly died out
          again, the people hasten to the herds, which have been waiting in
          the background, and drive them forcibly, one after the other,
          through the glow. As soon as all the beasts are through, the young
          folk rush wildly at the ashes and cinders, sprinkling and
          blackening each other with them; those who have been most sprinkled
          and blackened march in triumph behind the cattle into the village
          and do not wash themselves for a long time. If after long rubbing
          the linen should not catch fire, they guess that there is still
          fire somewhere in the village; then a strict search is made from
          house to house, any fire that may be found is put out, and the
          householder is punished or upbraided. The <span class=
          "tei tei-q">‘wild fire’</span> must be made by prolonged friction;
          it may not be struck with flint and steel. Some villages do not
          prepare it yearly as a preventive of cattle-plague, but only kindle
          it when the disease has actually broken out.”</span><a id=

          to the first half of the nineteenth century the practice was
          similar. We read that <span class="tei tei-q">“in many parts of the
          Mark there still prevails on certain occasions the custom of
          kindling a need-fire, it happens particularly when a farmer has
          sick pigs. Two posts of dry wood are planted in the earth amid
          solemn silence before the sun rises, and round these posts hempen
          ropes are pulled to and fro till the wood kindles; whereupon the
          fire is fed with dry leaves and twigs and the sick beasts are
          driven through it. In some places the fire is produced by the
          friction of an old cart-wheel.”</span><a id="noteref_696" name=

          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In Mecklenburg
          the need-fire used to be lighted by the friction of a rope wound
          about an oaken pole or by rubbing two boards against each other.
          Having been thus elicited, the flame was fed with wood of seven
          kinds. The practice was forbidden by Gustavus Adolphus, Duke of
          Mecklenburg, in 1682; but the prohibition apparently had little
          effect, for down to the end of the eighteenth century the custom
          was so common that the inhabitants even of large towns made no
          scruple of resorting to it. For example, in the month of July 1792
          sickness broke out among the cattle belonging to the town of
          Sternberg; some of the beasts died suddenly, and so the people
          resolved to drive all the survivors through a need-fire. On the
          tenth day of July the magistrates issued a proclamation announcing
          that next morning before sunrise a need-fire would be kindled for
          the behoof of all the cattle of the town, and warning all the
          inhabitants against lighting fires in their kitchens that evening.
          So next morning very early, about two o'clock, nearly the whole
          population was astir, and having assembled outside one of the gates
          of the town they helped to drive the timid cattle, not without much
          ado, through three separate need-fires; after which they dispersed
          to their homes in the unalterable conviction that they had rescued
          the cattle from destruction. But to make assurance doubly sure they
          deemed it advisable to administer the rest of the ashes as a bolus
          to the animals. However, some people in Mecklenburg used to strew
          the ashes of the need-fire on fields for the purpose of protecting
          the crops against vermin. As late as June 1868 a traveller in
          Mecklenburg saw a couple of peasants sweating away at a rope, which
          they were pulling backwards and forwards so as to make a tarry
          roller revolve with great speed in the socket of an upright post.
          Asked what they were about, they vouchsafed no reply; but an old
          woman who appeared on the scene from a neighbouring cottage was
          more communicative. In the fulness of her heart she confided to the
          stranger that her pigs were sick, that the two taciturn bumpkins
          were her sons, who were busy extracting a need-fire from the
          roller, and that, when they succeeded, the flame would be used to
          ignite a heap of rags and brushwood, through which <span class=

          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the ailing swine would be driven. She
          further explained that the persons who kindle a need-fire should
          always be two brothers or at least bear the same Christian
          name.<a id="noteref_697" name="noteref_697" href=

            </div>
          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the summer of
          1828 there was much sickness among the pigs and the cows of
          Eddesse, a village near Meinersen, in the south of Hanover. When
          all ordinary measures to arrest the malady failed, the farmers met
          in solemn conclave on the village green and determined that next
          morning there should be a need-fire. Thereupon the head man of the
          village sent word from house to house that on the following day
          nobody should kindle a fire before sunrise, and that everybody
          should stand by ready to drive out the cattle. The same afternoon
          all the necessary preparations were made for giving effect to the
          decision of the collective wisdom. A narrow street was enclosed
          with planks, and the village carpenter set to work at the machinery
          for kindling the fire. He took two posts of oak wood, bored a hole
          about three inches deep and broad in each, and set the two poles up
          facing each other at a distance of about two feet. Then he fitted a
          roller of oak wood into the two holes of the posts, so that it
          formed a cross-piece between them. About two o'clock next morning
          every householder brought a bundle of straw and brushwood and laid
          it down across the street in a prescribed order. The sturdiest
          swains who could be found were chosen to make the need-fire. For
          this purpose a long hempen rope was wound twice round the oaken
          roller in the oaken posts: the pivots were well smeared with pitch
          and tar: a bundle of tow and other tinder was laid close at hand,
          and all was ready. The stalwart clodhoppers now seized the two ends
          of the rope and went to work with a will. Puffs of smoke soon
          issued from the sockets, but to the consternation of the bystanders
          not a spark of fire could be elicited. Some people openly declared
          their suspicion that some rascal had not put out the fire in his
          house, when suddenly the tinder burst into flame. The cloud passed
          away from all faces; the fire was applied to the heaps of fuel, and
          when the flames had somewhat died down, the herds were forcibly
          driven through the fire, first the pigs, <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page276">[pg 276]</span><a name="Pg276" id="Pg276" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> next the cows, and last of all the horses.
          The herdsmen then drove the beasts to pasture, and persons whose
          faith in the efficacy of the need-fire was particularly robust
          carried home brands.<a id="noteref_698" name="noteref_698" href=

          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again, at a
          village near Quedlinburg, in the Harz Mountains, it was resolved to
          put a herd of sick swine through the need-fire. Hearing of this
          intention the Superintendent of Quedlinburg hurried to the spot and
          has described for us what he saw. The beadles went from house to
          house to see that there was no fire in any house; for it is well
          known that should there be common fire burning in a house the
          need-fire will not kindle. The men made their rounds very early in
          the morning to make quite sure that all lights were out. At two
          o'clock a night-light was still burning in the parsonage, and this
          was of course a hindrance to the need-fire. The peasants knocked at
          the window and earnestly entreated that the night-light might be
          extinguished. But the parson's wife refused to put the light out;
          it still glimmered at the window; and in the darkness outside the
          angry rustics vowed that the parson's pigs should get no benefit of
          the need-fire. However, as good luck would have it, just as the
          morning broke, the night-light went out of itself, and the hopes of
          the people revived. From every house bundles of straw, tow, faggots
          and so forth were now carried to feed the bonfire. The noise and
          the cheerful bustle were such that you might have thought they were
          all hurrying to witness a public execution. Outside the village,
          between two garden walls, an oaken post had been driven into the
          ground and a hole bored through it. In the hole a wooden winch,
          smeared with tar, was inserted and made to revolve with such force
          and rapidity that fire and smoke in time issued from the socket.
          The collected fuel was then thrown upon the fire and soon a great
          blaze shot up. The pigs were now driven into the upper end of the
          street. As soon as they saw the fire, they turned tail, but the
          peasants drove them through with shrieks and shouts and lashes of
          whips. At the other end of the street there was another crowd
          waiting, who <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page277">[pg
          277]</span><a name="Pg277" id="Pg277" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          chased the swine back through the fire a second time. Then the
          other crowd repeated the manœuvre, and the herd of swine was driven
          for the third time through the smoke and flames. That was the end
          of the performance. Many pigs were scorched so severely that they
          gave up the ghost. The bonfire was broken up, and every householder
          took home with him a brand, which he washed in the water-barrel and
          laid for some time, as a treasure of great price, in the manger
          from which the cattle were fed. But the parson's wife had reason
          bitterly to repent her folly in refusing to put out that
          night-light; for not one of her pigs was driven through the
          need-fire, so they died.<a id="noteref_699" name="noteref_699"

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In Brunswick,
          also, the need-fire is known to have been repeatedly kindled during
          the nineteenth century. After driving the pigs through the fire,
          which was kindled by the friction of wood, some people took brands
          home, dipped them in water, and then gave the water to the pigs to
          drink, no doubt for the purpose of inoculating them still more
          effectually with the precious virtue of the need-fire. In the
          villages of the Drömling district everybody who bore a hand in
          kindling the <span class="tei tei-q">“wild fire”</span> must have
          the same Christian name; otherwise they laboured in vain. The fire
          was produced by the friction of a rope round the beams of a door;
          and bread, corn, and old boots contributed their mites to swell the
          blaze through which the pigs as usual were driven. In one place,
          apparently not far from Wolfenbüttel, the need-fire is said to have
          been kindled, contrary to custom, by the smith striking a spark
          from the cold anvil.<a id="noteref_700" name="noteref_700" href=

          Gandersheim down to about the beginning of the nineteenth century
          the need-fire was lit in the common way by causing a cross-bar to
          revolve rapidly on its axis between two upright posts. The rope
          which produced the revolution of the bar had to be new, but it was
          if possible woven from threads taken from a gallows-rope, with
          which people had been hanged. While the need-fire was being kindled
          in this fashion, every other fire in the town had to be put out;
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page278">[pg 278]</span><a name=
          "Pg278" id="Pg278" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> search was made
          through the houses, and any fire discovered to be burning was
          extinguished. If in spite of every precaution no flame could be
          elicited by the friction of the rope, the failure was set down to
          witchcraft; but if the efforts were successful, a bonfire was lit
          with the new fire, and when the flames had died down, the sick
          swine were driven thrice through the glowing embers.<a id=

          the lower Rhine the need-fire is said to have been kindled by the
          friction of oak-wood on fir-wood, all fires in the village having
          been previously extinguished. The bonfires so kindled were composed
          of wood of nine different sorts; there were three such bonfires,
          and the cattle were driven round them with great gravity and
          devotion.<a id="noteref_702" name="noteref_702" href=

          friction of nine kinds of wood, and the flame so obtained was used
          to kindle heaps of brushwood or straw to which every inhabitant had
          contributed. Through these fires the cattle, both sick and sound,

          wood of the tree and the splinters from the thresholds furnish the
          fuel of a bonfire, which is kindled by the rubbing of two pieces of
          wood together. When the bonfire is ablaze, the horns of the cattle
          are pared and the parings thrown into the flames, after which the
          animals are driven through the fire. This is believed to guard the

          bonfire, through which the cattle are driven in the usual way. And

          board against his breast, takes a peg pointed at both ends, and,
          setting one end of the peg against the board on his breast, presses
          the other end firmly against a second board, the surface of which
          has been flaked into a nap. A string is tied round the peg, and two
          other boys pull it to and fro, till through the rapid motion of the
          point of the peg a hole is burnt in the flaked board, to which tow
          or dry moss is then applied as a tinder. In this way fire and smoke
          are elicited, and with their appearance the children fancy that the

          nine different kinds of wood were used for the purpose. The smoke

          of medicinal power to fire kindled by the friction of wood is said
          to be especially characteristic of the Slavs who inhabit the
          Carpathian Mountains and the Balkan peninsula. The mode in which
          they produce the need-fire differs somewhat in different places.
          Thus in the Schar mountains of Servia the task is entrusted to a
          boy and girl between eleven and fourteen years of age. They are led
          into a perfectly dark room, and having stripped themselves naked
          kindle the fire by rubbing two rollers of lime wood against each
          other, till the friction produces sparks, which are caught in
          tinder. The Serbs of Western Macedonia drive two oaken posts into
          the ground, bore a round hole in the upper end of each, insert a
          roller of lime wood in the holes, and set it revolving rapidly by
          means of a cord, which is looped round the roller and worked by a
          bow. Elsewhere the roller is put in motion by two men, who hold
          each one end of the cord and pull it backwards and forwards
          forcibly between them. Bulgarian shepherds sometimes kindle the
          need-fire by drawing a prism-shaped piece of lime wood to and fro
          across the flat surface of a tree-stump in the forest.<a id=

          practised in Slavonia, the custom of the need-fire used to present
          some interesting features, which are best described in the words of
          an eye-witness:—<span class="tei tei-q">“In the year 1833 I came
          for the first time as a young merchant to Slavonia; it was to Gaj
          that I went, in the Požega district. The time was autumn, and it
          chanced that a cattle-plague was raging in the neighbourhood, which
          inflicted much loss on the people. The peasants believed that the
          plague was a woman, an evil spirit (<span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Kuga</span></span>), who was destroying the
          cattle; so they sought to banish her. I had then occasion to
          observe the proceedings in the villages of Gaj, Kukunjevac,
          Brezina, and Brekinjska. Towards evening the whole population of
          the village was busy laying a ring of brushwood round the
          boundaries of the village. All fires were extinguished throughout
          the village. Then pairs of men in several places took pieces of
          wood, which had been specially prepared for the purpose, and rubbed
          them together till they emitted sparks. The sparks were allowed to
          fall on tinder and fanned into a flame, with which the dry
          brushwood was kindled. Thus the fire burned all round the village.
          The peasants persuaded themselves that thereupon <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Kuga</span></span> must take her
          departure.”</span><a id="noteref_715" name="noteref_715" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This last
          account leaves no doubt as to the significance of the need-fire in
          the minds of Slavonian peasantry. They regard it simply as a
          barrier interposed between their cattle and the evil spirit, which
          prowls, like a hungry wolf, round the fold and can, like a wolf, be
          kept at bay by fire. The same interpretation of the need-fire comes
          out, hardly less clearly, in the account which another writer gives
          of a ceremony witnessed by him at the village of Setonje, at the
          foot of the Homolje mountains in the great forest of Servia. An
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page283">[pg 283]</span><a name=
          "Pg283" id="Pg283" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> epidemic was raging
          among the children, and the need-fire was resorted to as a means of
          staying the plague. It was produced by an old man and an old woman
          in the first of the ways described above; that is, they made it in
          the dark by rubbing two sticks of lime wood against each other.
          Before the healing virtue of the fire was applied to the
          inhabitants of the village, two old women performed the following
          ceremony. Both bore the name of Stana, from the verb <span lang=
          "sr" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sr"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">stati</span></span>, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“to remain standing”</span>; for the ceremony could not
          be successfully performed by persons of any other name. One of them
          carried a copper kettle full of water, the other an old house-lock
          with the key. Thus equipped they repaired to a spot outside of the
          village, and there the old dame with the kettle asked the old dame
          with the lock, <span class="tei tei-q">“Whither away?”</span> and
          the other answered her, <span class="tei tei-q">“I came to shut the
          village against ill-luck.”</span> With that she locked the lock and
          threw it with the key into the kettle of water. Then they marched
          thrice round the village, repeating the ceremony of the lock and
          key at each round. Meantime all the villagers, arrayed in their
          best clothes, were assembled in an open place. All the fires in the
          houses had been previously extinguished. Two sturdy yokels now dug
          a tunnel through a mound beside an oak tree; the tunnel was just
          high enough to let a man creep through it on all fours. Two fires,
          lit by the need-fire, were now laid, one at each end of the tunnel;
          and the old woman with the kettle took her stand at the entrance of
          the tunnel, while the one with the lock posted herself at the exit.
          Facing the latter stood another woman with a great pot of milk
          before her, and on the other side was set a pot full of melted
          swine's fat. All was now ready. The villagers thereupon crawled
          through the tunnel on hands and knees, one behind the other. Each,
          as he emerged from the tunnel, received a spoonful of milk from the
          woman and looked at his face reflected in the pot of melted swine's
          fat. Then another woman made a cross with a piece of charcoal on
          his back. When all the inhabitants had thus crept through the
          tunnel and been doctored at the other end, each took some glowing
          embers home with him in a pot wherewith to rekindle the fire on the
          domestic hearth. Lastly they put some of the charcoal in a vessel
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page284">[pg 284]</span><a name=
          "Pg284" id="Pg284" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of water and drank
          the mixture in order to be thereby magically protected against the

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In Bulgaria the
          herds suffer much from the raids of certain blood-sucking vampyres
          called <span lang="bg" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
          "bg"><span style="font-style: italic">Ustrels</span></span>. An
          <span lang="bg" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="bg"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Ustrel</span></span> is the spirit of a
          Christian child who was born on a Saturday and died unfortunately
          before he could be baptized. On the ninth day after burial he grubs
          his way out of the grave and attacks the cattle at once, sucking
          their blood all night and returning at peep of dawn to the grave to
          rest from his labours. In ten days or so the copious draughts of
          blood which he has swallowed have so fortified his constitution
          that he can undertake longer journeys; so when he falls in with
          great herds of cattle or flocks of sheep he returns no more to the
          grave for rest and refreshment at night, but takes up his quarters
          during the day either between the horns of a sturdy calf or ram or
          between the hind legs of a milch-cow. Beasts whose blood he has
          sucked die the same night. In any herd that he may fasten on he
          begins with the fattest animal and works his way down steadily
          through the leaner kine till not one single beast is left alive.
          The carcases of the victims swell up, and when the hide is stripped
          off you can always perceive the livid patch of flesh where the
          monster sucked the blood of the poor creature. In a single night he
          may, by working hard, kill five cows; but he seldom exceeds that
          number. He can change his shape and weight very easily; for
          example, when he is sitting by day between the horns of a ram, the
          animal scarcely feels his weight, but at night he will sometimes
          throw himself on an ox or a cow <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page285">[pg 285]</span><a name="Pg285" id="Pg285" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> so heavily that the animal cannot stir, and
          lows so pitifully that it would make your heart bleed to hear.
          People who were born on a Saturday can see these monsters, and they
          have described them accurately, so that there can be no doubt
          whatever about their existence. It is, therefore, a matter of great
          importance to the peasant to protect his flocks and herds against
          the ravages of such dangerous vampyres. The way in which he does so
          is this. On a Saturday morning before sunrise the village drummer
          gives the signal to put out every fire in the village; even smoking
          is forbidden. Next all the domestic animals, with the exception of
          fowls, geese, and ducks, are driven out into the open. In front of
          the flocks and herds march two men, whose names during the ceremony
          may not be mentioned in the village. They go into the wood, pick
          two dry branches, and having stript themselves of their clothes
          they rub the two branches together very hard till they catch fire;
          then with the fire so obtained they kindle two bonfires, one on
          each side of a cross-road which is known to be frequented by
          wolves. After that the herd is driven between the two fires. Coals
          from the bonfires are then taken back to the village and used to
          rekindle the fires on the domestic hearths. For several days no one
          may go near the charred and blackened remains of the bonfires at
          the cross-road. The reason is that the vampyre is lying there,
          having dropped from his seat between the cow's horns when the
          animals were driven between the two fires. So if any one were to
          pass by the spot during these days, the monster would be sure to
          call him by name and to follow him to the village; whereas if he is
          left alone, a wolf will come at midnight and strangle him, and in a
          few days the herdsmen can see the ground soaked with his slimy
          blood. So that is the end of the vampyre.<a id="noteref_718" name=

          this Bulgarian custom, as in the Slavonian custom described above,
          the conception of the need-fire as a barrier set up between the

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In Bosnia and
          Herzegovina there are some local differences in the mode of
          kindling the need-fire, or <span class="tei tei-q">“living
          fire,”</span> as it is called. Thus at Jablanica both the uprights
          and the roller or cross-piece, which by its revolution kindles the
          fire, are made of cornel-tree wood; whereas at Dolac, near
          Sarajevo, the uprights and the cross-piece or roller are all made
          of lime wood. In Gacko, contrary to the usual custom, the fire is
          made by striking a piece of iron on an anvil, till sparks are given
          out, which are caught in tinder. The <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“living fire”</span> thus produced is employed for
          purposes of healing. In particular, if any one suffers from wounds
          or sores, ashes of the need-fire are sprinkled on the ailing part.
          In Gacko it is also believed that if a pregnant woman witnesses a
          conflagration, her child will either be born with a red eruption on
          its skin or will contract the malady sooner or later afterwards.
          The only remedy consists in ashes of the need-fire, which are mixed
          with water and given to the child to drink.<a id="noteref_719"

          the cattle, <span class="tei tei-q">“certain beastly men, monks in
          garb but not in mind, taught the idiots of their country to make

          people, not only in the way of cure, but of prevention, was an odd
          one; it was to smoke the cattle almost to suffocation, by kindling
          straw, litter, and other combustible matter about them. The effects
          of this mode of cure are not stated, but the most singular part of
          it was that by which it was reported to have been discovered. An
          angel (says the legend), descended into Yorkshire, and there set a
          large tree on fire; the strange appearance of which or else the
          savour of the smoke, incited the cattle around (some of which were
          infected) to draw near the miracle, when they all either received
          an immediate cure or an absolute prevention of the disorder. It is
          not affirmed that the angel staid to speak to anybody, but only
          that he left a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          neighbouring people to catch this supernatural fire, and to
          communicate it from one to another with all possible speed
          throughout the country; and in case it should be extinguished and
          utterly lost, that then new fire, of equal virtue, might be
          obtained, not by any common method, but by rubbing two pieces of
          wood together till they ignited. Upon what foundation this story
          stood, is not exactly known, but it put the farmers actually into a
          hurry of communicating flame and smoke from one house to another
          with wonderful speed, making it run like wildfire over the

          Again, we read that <span class="tei tei-q">“the father of the

          remembrance of a great number of persons, belonging to the upper
          and middle classes of his native parish of Bowes, assembling on the
          banks of the river Greta to work for need-fire. A disease among
          cattle, called the murrain, then prevailed to a very great extent
          through that district of Yorkshire. The cattle were made to pass
          through the smoke raised by this miraculous fire, and their cure
          was looked upon as certain, and to neglect doing so was looked upon
          as wicked. This fire was produced by the violent and continued
          friction of two dry pieces of wood until such time as it was

          several days running. They attributed this failure to the obstinacy
          of one householder, who would not let his fires be put out for what
          he considered so wrong a purpose. However, by bribing his servants
          they contrived to have them extinguished and on that morning raised

          Morven, who came over as master of the ceremonies, and who
          continued speaking all the time the fire was being raised. This man
          was living a beggar at Bellochroy. Asked to repeat the spell, he
          said, the sin of repeating it once had brought him to beggary, and

          friction, thus; upon any small island, where the stream of a river

          and turf, as it could be had, in <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          birch, or other hard wood, was set; and, in short, a roof closed on
          it. A straight pole was set up in the centre of this building, the
          upper end fixed by a wooden pin to the top of the couple, and the
          lower end in an oblong <span lang="gd" class="tei tei-foreign"
          xml:lang="gd"><span style="font-style: italic">trink</span></span>
          in the earth or floor; and lastly, another pole was set across
          horizontally, having both ends tapered, one end of which was
          supported in a hole in the side of the perpendicular pole, and the
          other in a similar hole in the couple leg. The horizontal stick was
          called the auger, having four short arms or levers fixed in its
          centre, to work it by; the building having been thus finished, as
          many men as could be collected in the vicinity, (being divested of
          all kinds of metal in their clothes, etc.), would set to work with
          the said auger, two after two, constantly turning it round by the
          arms or levers, and others occasionally driving wedges of wood or
          stone behind the lower end of the upright pole, so as to press it
          the more on the end of the auger: by this constant friction and
          pressure, the ends of the auger would take fire, from which a fire
          would be instantly kindled, and thus the <em class=

          The fire in the farmer's house, etc., was immediately quenched with
          water, a fire kindled from this need-fire, both in the farm-houses
          and offices, and the cattle brought to feel the smoke of this new

          down to about the end of the nineteenth century; apparently the
          mode of operation was the one known as the fire-drill: a pointed

          accounts for the past, and to plan operations for the new season.
          My mother and the rest of us were sent to bed. I lay in the
          kitchen, and was listening and watching, though they thought I was
          asleep. After the men had settled their past affairs and future
          plans, they put out the fire on the hearth, not a spark being
          allowed to live. They then rubbed two pieces of wood one against
          another so rapidly as to produce fire, the men joining in one after
          the other, and working with the utmost energy and never allowing
          the friction to relax. From this friction-fire they rekindled the
          fire on the hearth, from which all the men present carried away a
          kindling to their own homes. Whether their success was due to their
          skill, their industry, their perseverance, or to the neid-fire, I
          do not know, but I know that they were much the most successful
          crew in the place. They met on Saturday, and went to church on
          Sunday like the good men <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page295">[pg

          mingling with their Christian belief. I have reason to believe that

          Beltane Eve or the Eve of May Day (Walpurgis Night) is the great
          witching time of the year throughout Europe, we may surmise that
          wherever bonfires have been ceremonially kindled on that day it has
          been done simply as a precaution against witchcraft; indeed this
          motive is expressly alleged not only in Scotland, but in Wales, the

          deserves, further, to be noticed that in North Uist the wood used
          to kindle the need-fire was oak, and that the nine times nine men
          by whose exertions the flame was elicited were all first-born sons.
          Apparently the first-born son of a family was thought to be endowed
          with more magical virtue than his younger brothers. Similarly in
          the Punjaub <span class="tei tei-q">“the supernatural power
          ascribed to the first born is not due to his being unlucky, but the
          idea underlying the belief seems to be that being the first product

          a high degree. The success of such persons in stopping rain and
          hail and in stupefying snakes is proverbial. It is believed that a

          by the friction of wood for the purpose of curing or preventing the
          spread of disease, particularly among cattle. The mode of striking
          a light by rubbing two dry sticks against each other is the one to
          which all over the world savages have most commonly resorted for
          the sake of providing themselves with fire;<a id="noteref_739"

          we can scarcely doubt that the practice of kindling the need-fire
          in this primitive fashion is merely a survival from the time
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page298">[pg 298]</span><a name=
          "Pg298" id="Pg298" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> when our savage
          forefathers lit all their fires in that way. Nothing is so
          conservative of old customs as religious or magical ritual, which
          invests these relics of the past with an atmosphere of mysterious
          virtue and sanctity. To the educated mind it seems obvious that a
          fire which a man kindles with the sweat of his brow by laboriously
          rubbing one stick against each other can possess neither more nor
          less virtue than one which he has struck in a moment by the
          friction of a lucifer match; but to the ignorant and superstitious
          this truth is far from apparent, and accordingly they take infinite
          pains to do in a roundabout way what they might have done directly
          with the greatest ease, and what, even when it is done, is of no
          use whatever for the purpose in hand. A vast proportion of the
          labour which mankind has expended throughout the ages has been no
          better spent; it has been like the stone of Sisyphus eternally
          rolled up hill only to revolve eternally down again, or like the
          water poured for ever by the Danaids into broken pitchers which it
          could never fill.</p>

          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The curious
          notion that the need-fire cannot kindle if any other fire remains
          alight in the neighbourhood seems to imply that fire is conceived
          as a unity which is broken up into fractions and consequently
          weakened in exact proportion to the number of places where it
          burns; hence in order to obtain it at full strength you must light
          it only at a single point, for then the flame will burst out with a
          concentrated energy derived from the tributary fires which burned
          on all the extinguished hearths of the country. So in a modern city
          if all the gas were turned off simultaneously at all the burners
          but one, the flame would no doubt blaze at that one burner with a
          fierceness such as no single burner could shew when all are burning
          at the same time. The analogy may help us to understand the process
          of reasoning which leads the peasantry to insist on the extinction
          of all common fires when the need-fire is about to be kindled.
          Perhaps, too, it may partly explain that ceremonial extinction of
          all old fires on other occasions which is often required by custom
          as a preliminary to the lighting of a new and sacred fire.<a id=

          no doubt the reason for the extinction was the same as in the case
          of the need-fire. Indeed we may assume with a fair degree of
          probability that the need-fire was the parent of the periodic
          fire-festivals; at first invoked only at irregular intervals to
          cure certain evils as they occurred, the powerful virtue of fire
          was afterwards employed at regular intervals to prevent the
          occurrence of the same evils as well as to remedy such as had
          actually arisen.</p>

          the Iroquois Indians of North America. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Formerly when an epidemic prevailed among the Iroquois
          despite the efforts to stay it, it was customary for the principal
          shaman to order the fires in every cabin to be extinguished and the
          ashes and cinders to be carefully removed; for it was believed that
          the pestilence was sent as a punishment for neglecting to rekindle
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘new fire’</span> or because of the manner
          in which the fire then in use had been kindled. So, after all the
          fires were out, two suitable logs of slippery elm (<span lang="la"
          class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Ulmus fulva</span></span>) were provided for
          the new fire. One of the logs was from six to eight inches in
          diameter and from eight to ten feet long; the other was from ten to
          twelve inches in diameter and about ten feet long. About midway
          across the larger log a cuneiform notch or cut about six inches
          deep was made, and in the wedge-shaped notch punk was placed. The
          other log was drawn rapidly to and fro in the cut by four strong
          men chosen for the purpose until the punk was ignited by the
          friction thus produced. Before and during the progress of the work
          of igniting the fire the shaman votively sprinkled <span class=

          (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          <span class="tei tei-q">‘for good luck.’</span> ”</span><a id=

          not here said that the fire was a need-fire, of which indeed the

          renders it probable that in Northamptonshire also the fire was
          kindled by the friction of wood, and that the calf or some part of
          it was burnt in the fire. Certainly the practice of burning a
          single animal alive in order to save all the others would seem to
          have been not uncommon in England down to the nineteenth century.
          Thus a farmer in Cornwall about the year 1800, having lost many
          cattle by disease, and tried many remedies in vain, consulted with
          some of his neighbours and laying their heads together <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“they recalled to their recollections a tale, which
          tradition had handed down from remote antiquity, that the calamity
          would not cease until he had actually burned alive the finest calf
          which he had upon his farm; but that, when this sacrifice was made,
          the murrain would afflict his cattle no more.”</span> Accordingly,
          on a day appointed they met, lighted a large fire, placed the best
          calf in it, and standing round the blazing <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page301">[pg 301]</span><a name="Pg301" id="Pg301" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> pile drove the animal with pitchforks back
          into the flames whenever it attempted to escape. Thus the victim
          was burned alive to save the rest of the cattle.<a id="noteref_745"
          name="noteref_745" href="#note_745"><span class=

          <span class="tei tei-q">“There can be no doubt but that a belief
          prevailed until a very recent period, amongst the small farmers in
          the districts remote from towns in Cornwall, that a living
          sacrifice appeased the wrath of God. This sacrifice must be by
          fire; and I have heard it argued that the Bible gave them warranty
          for this belief.... While correcting these sheets I am informed of
          two recent instances of this superstition. One of them was the
          sacrifice of a calf by a farmer near Portreath, for the purpose of
          removing a disease which had long followed his horses and his cows.
          The other was the burning of a living lamb, to save, as the farmer
          said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘his flocks from spells which had

          recent account of the fire-festivals of Wales we read that
          <span class="tei tei-q">“I have also heard my grandfather and
          father say that in times gone by the people would throw a calf in
          the fire when there was any disease among the herds. The same would
          be done with a sheep if there was anything the matter with a flock.
          I can remember myself seeing cattle being driven between two fires
          to <span class="tei tei-q">‘stop the disease spreading.’</span>
          When in later times it was not considered humane to drive the
          cattle between the fires, the herdsmen were accustomed to force the
          animals over the wood ashes to protect them against various
          ailments.”</span><a id="noteref_747" name="noteref_747" href=

          Writing about 1866, the antiquary W. Henderson says that a live ox
          was burned near Haltwhistle in Northumberland <span class=

          and the charm was got. One chief thing ordered was to burn to death
          a pig, and sprinkle the ashes over the byre and other farm
          buildings. This order was carried out, except that the pig was
          killed before it was burned. A more terrible sacrifice was made at
          times. One of the diseased animals was rubbed over with tar, driven

          believed that this was a remedy for the <span class=

          Again, we read that <span class="tei tei-q">“a farmer, who
          possessed broad acres, and who was in many respects a sensible man,
          was greatly annoyed to find that his cattle became diseased in the
          spring. Nothing could satisfy him but that they were bewitched, and
          he was resolved to find out the person who had cast the evil eye on
          his oxen. According to an anciently-prescribed rule, the farmer
          took one of his bullocks and bled it to death, catching all the
          blood on bundles of straw. The bloody straw was then piled into a
          heap, and set on fire. Burning with a vast quantity of smoke, the
          farmer expected to see the witch, either in reality or in shadow,
          amidst the smoke.”</span><a id="noteref_752" name="noteref_752"

          influences of the evil eye, of forespeaking, and of the casting of
          evil. Witches and warlocks did the work of evil among their
          neighbours' cattle if their anger had been aroused in any way. The
          fairies often wrought injury amongst cattle. Every animal that died
          suddenly was killed by the dart of the fairies, or, in the language
          of the people, was <span class="tei tei-q">‘shot-a-dead.’</span>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But how, we must
          still ask, can burning an animal alive break the spell that has
          been cast upon its fellows by a witch or a warlock? Some light is
          thrown on the question by the following account of measures which
          rustic wiseacres in Suffolk are said to have adopted as a remedy
          for witchcraft. <span class="tei tei-q">“A woman I knew forty-three
          years had been employed by my predecessor to take care of his
          poultry. At the time I came to make her acquaintance she was a
          bedridden toothless crone, with chin and nose all but meeting. She
          did <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page304">[pg 304]</span><a name=
          "Pg304" id="Pg304" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> not discourage in
          her neighbours the idea that she knew more than people ought to
          know, and had more power than others had. Many years before I knew
          her it happened one spring that the ducks, which were a part of her
          charge, failed to lay eggs.... She at once took it for granted that
          the ducks had been bewitched. This misbelief involved very shocking
          consequences, for it necessitated the idea that so diabolical an
          act could only be combated by diabolical cruelty. And the most
          diabolical act of cruelty she could imagine was that of baking
          alive in a hot oven one of the ducks. And that was what she did.
          The sequence of thought in her mind was that the spell that had
          been laid on the ducks was that of preternaturally wicked
          wilfulness; that this spell could only be broken through intensity
          of suffering, in this case death by burning; that the intensity of
          suffering would break the spell in the one roasted to death; and
          that the spell broken in one would be altogether broken, that is,
          in all the ducks.... Shocking, however, as was this method of
          exorcising the ducks, there was nothing in it original. Just about
          a hundred years before, everyone in the town and neighbourhood of
          Ipswich had heard, and many had believed, that a witch had been
          burnt to death in her own house at Ipswich by the process of
          burning alive one of the sheep she had bewitched. It was curious,
          but it was as convincing as curious, that the hands and feet of
          this witch were the only parts of her that had not been
          incinerated. This, however, was satisfactorily explained by the
          fact that the four feet of the sheep, by which it had been
          suspended over the fire, had not been destroyed in the flames that
          had consumed its body.”</span><a id="noteref_754" name=

          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This last
          anecdote is instructive, if perhaps not strictly authentic. It
          shews that in burning alive one of a bewitched flock or herd what
          you really do is to burn the witch, who is either actually
          incarnate in the animal or perhaps more probably stands in a
          relation of sympathy with it so close as almost to amount to
          identity. Hence if you burn the creature to ashes, you utterly
          destroy the witch and thereby save the whole of the rest of the
          flock or herd from her abominable machinations; whereas if you only
          partially burn the animal, allowing some parts of it to escape the
          flames, the witch is only half-baked, and her power for mischief
          may be hardly, if at all, impaired by the grilling. We can now see
          that in such matters half-measures are useless. To kill the animal
          first and burn it afterwards is a weak compromise, dictated no
          doubt by a well-meant but utterly mistaken kindness; it is like
          shutting the stable-door when the steed is stolen, for obviously by
          leaving the animal's, and therefore the witch's, body nearly intact
          at the moment of death, it allows her soul to escape and return
          safe and sound to her own human body, which all the time is
          probably lying quietly at home in bed. And the same train of
          reasoning that justifies the burning alive of bewitched animals
          justifies and indeed requires the burning alive of the witches
          themselves; it is really the only way of destroying them, body and
          soul, and therefore of thoroughly extirpating the whole infernal
          crew.</p>

          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the Isle of
          Man the practice of burning cattle alive in order to stop a murrain
          seems to have persisted down to a time within living memory. On
          this subject I will quote the evidence collected by Sir John Rhys:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“A respectable farmer from Andreas told me
          that he was driving with his wife to the neighbouring parish of
          Jurby some years ago, and that on the way they beheld the carcase
          of a cow or an ox burning in a field, with a woman engaged in
          stirring the fire. On reaching the village to which they were
          going, they found that the burning beast belonged to a farmer
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page306">[pg 306]</span><a name=
          "Pg306" id="Pg306" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> whom they knew. They
          were further told it was no wonder that the said farmer had one of
          his cattle burnt, as several of them had recently died. Whether
          this was a case of sacrifice or not I cannot say. But let me give
          you another instance: a man whom I have already mentioned, saw at a
          farm nearer the centre of the island a live calf being burnt. The
          owner bears an English name, but his family has long been settled
          in Man. The farmer's explanation to my informant was that the calf
          was burnt to secure luck for the rest of the herd, some of which
          were threatening to die. My informant thought there was absolutely
          nothing the matter with them, except that they had too little to
          eat. Be that as it may, the one calf was sacrificed as a
          burnt-offering to secure luck for the rest of the cattle. Let me
          here also quote Mr. Moore's note in his <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Manx
          Surnames</span></span>, p. 184, on the place name <span lang="gv"
          class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="gv"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Cabbal yn Oural Losht</span></span>, or the
          Chapel of the Burnt Sacrifice. <span class="tei tei-q">‘This
          name,’</span> he says, <span class="tei tei-q">‘records a
          circumstance which took place in the nineteenth century, but which,
          it is to be hoped, was never customary in the Isle of Man. A
          farmer, who had lost a number of his sheep and cattle by murrain,
          burned a calf as a propitiatory offering to the Deity on this spot,
          where a chapel was afterwards built. Hence the name.’</span>
          Particulars, I may say, of time, place, and person could be easily
          added to Mr. Moore's statement, excepting, perhaps as to the deity
          in question; on that point I have never been informed, but Mr.
          Moore is probably right in the use of the capital <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">d</span></em>, as
          the sacrificer is, according to all accounts, a highly devout
          Christian. One more instance: an octogenarian woman, born in the
          parish of Bride, and now living at Kirk Andreas, saw, when she was
          a <span class="tei tei-q">‘lump of a girl’</span> of ten or fifteen
          years of age, a live sheep being burnt in a field in the parish of
          Andreas, on May-day, whereby she meant the first of May reckoned
          according to the Old Style. She asserts very decidedly that it was
          <span lang="gv" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="gv"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">son oural</span></span>, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">‘as a sacrifice,’</span> as she put it, and
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘for an object to the public’</span>: those
          were her words when she expressed herself in English. Further, she
          made the statement that it was a custom to burn a sheep on old
          May-day for a sacrifice. I was fully alive to the interest of this
          evidence, and cross-examined her so far as <span class="tei tei-pb"

          their reasons for burning the living animals. On this subject I
          will again quote Sir John Rhys: <span class="tei tei-q">“When a
          beast dies on a farm, of course it dies, according to the
          old-fashioned view of things, as I understand it, from the
          influence of the evil eye or the interposition of a witch. So if
          you want to know to whom you are indebted for the loss of the
          beast, you have simply to burn its carcase in the open air and
          watch who comes first to the spot or who first passes by; that is
          the criminal to be charged with the death of the animal, and he
          cannot help coming there—such is the effect of the fire. A Michael
          woman, who is now about thirty, related to me how she watched while
          the carcase of a bewitched colt was burning, how she saw the witch
          coming, and how she remembers her shrivelled face, with nose and
          chin in close proximity. According to another native of Michael, a
          well-informed middle-aged man, the animal in question was oftenest
          a calf, and it was wont to be burnt whole, skin and all. The
          object, according to him, is invariably to bring the bewitcher on
          the spot, and he always comes; but I am not clear what happens to
          him when he appears. My informant added, however, that it was
          believed that, unless the bewitcher got possession of the heart of
          the burning beast, he lost all his power of
          bewitching.”</span><a id="noteref_757" name="noteref_757" href=

          by burning the animal you compel the witch to appear. The original
          idea may have been that, by virtue of a magic sympathy which binds
          the two together, whatever harm you do to the animal is felt by the
          witch as if it were done to herself. That notion would fully
          explain why Manx people used also to burn bewitched animals alive;
          in doing so they probably imagined that they were simultaneously
          burning the witch who had cast the spell on their cattle.</p>

          of the reason for burning a bewitched animal, dead or alive, is

          commonly supposed that certain men and women can transform
          themselves by magic art into wolves or other animals, but that any
          wound inflicted on such a transformed beast (a were-wolf or other
          were-animal) is simultaneously inflicted on the human body of the
          witch or warlock who had transformed herself or himself into the
          creature. This belief is widely diffused; it meets us in Europe,
          Asia, and Africa. For example, Olaus Magnus tells us that in
          Livonia, not many years before he wrote, a noble lady had a dispute
          with her slave on the subject of were-wolves, she doubting whether
          there were any such things, and he maintaining that there were. To
          convince her he retired to a room, from which he soon appeared in
          the form of a wolf. Being chased by the dogs into the forest and
          brought to bay, the wolf defended himself fiercely, but lost an eye
          in the struggle. Next day the slave returned to his mistress in
          human form but with only one eye.<a id="noteref_758" name=

          Again, it happened in the year 1588 that a gentleman in a village
          among the mountains of Auvergne, looking out of the window one
          evening, saw a friend of his going out to hunt. He begged him to
          bring him back some of his bag, and his friend said that he would.
          Well, he had not gone very far before he met a huge wolf. He fired
          and missed it, and the animal attacked him furiously, but he stood
          on his guard and with an adroit stroke of his <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page309">[pg 309]</span><a name="Pg309" id="Pg309"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> hunting knife he cut off the right
          fore-paw of the brute, which thereupon fled away and he saw it no
          more. He returned to his friend, and drawing from his pouch the
          severed paw of the wolf he found to his horror that it was turned
          into a woman's hand with a golden ring on one of the fingers. His
          friend recognized the ring as that of his own wife and went to find
          her. She was sitting by the fire with her right arm under her
          apron. As she refused to draw it out, her husband confronted her
          with the hand and the ring on it. She at once confessed the truth,
          that it was she in the form of a were-wolf whom the hunter had
          wounded. Her confession was confirmed by applying the severed hand
          to the stump of her arm, for the two fitted exactly. The angry
          husband delivered up his wicked wife to justice; she was tried and

          Again, in a farm of the French district of Beauce, there was once a
          herdsman who never slept at home. These nocturnal absences
          naturally attracted attention and set people talking. At the same
          time, by a curious coincidence, a wolf used to prowl round the farm
          every night and to excite the dogs in the farmyard to fury by
          thrusting his snout derisively through the cat's hole in the great
          gate. The farmer had his suspicions and he determined to watch. One
          night, when the herdsman went out as usual, his master followed him
          quietly till he came to a hut, where with his own eyes he saw the
          man put on a broad belt and at once turn into a wolf, which scoured
          away over the fields. The farmer smiled a sickly sort of smile and
          went back to the farm. There he took a stout stick and sat down at
          the cat's hole to wait. He had not long to wait. The dogs barked
          like mad, a wolf's snout shewed through the hole, down came the
          stick, out gushed the blood, and a voice was heard to say without
          the gate, <span class="tei tei-q">“A good job too. I had still
          three years to run.”</span> Next day the herdsman appeared as
          usual, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page310">[pg
          310]</span><a name="Pg310" id="Pg310" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          but he had a scar on his brow, and he never went out again at
          night.<a id="noteref_761" name="noteref_761" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In China also
          the faith in similar transformations is reflected in the following
          tale. A certain man in Sungyang went into the mountains to gather
          fuel. Night fell and he was pursued by two tigers, but scrambled up
          a tree out of their reach. Then said the one tiger to the other
          tiger, <span class="tei tei-q">“If we can find Chu-Tu-shi, we are
          sure to catch this man up the tree.”</span> So off went one of them
          to find Chu-Tu-shi, while the other kept watch at the foot of the
          tree. Soon after that another tiger, leaner and longer than the
          other two, appeared on the scene and made a grab at the man's coat.
          But fortunately the moon was shining, the man saw the paw, and with
          a stroke of his axe cut off one of its claws. The tigers roared and
          fled, one after the other, so the man climbed down the tree and
          went home. When he told his tale in the village, suspicion
          naturally fell on the said Chu-Tu-shi; and next day some men went
          to see him in his house. They <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page311">[pg 311]</span><a name="Pg311" id="Pg311" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> were told that they could not see him; for he
          had been out the night before and had hurt his hand, and he was now
          ill in bed. So they put two and two together and reported him to
          the police. The police arrived, surrounded the house, and set fire
          to it; but Chu-Tu-shi rose from his bed, turned into a tiger,
          charged right through the police, and escaped, and to this day
          nobody ever knew where he went to.<a id="noteref_762" name=

            </div>
          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Toradjas of
          Central Celebes stand in very great fear of were-wolves, that is of
          men and women, who have the power of transforming their spirits
          into animals such as cats, crocodiles, wild pigs, apes, deer, and
          buffaloes, which roam about battening on human flesh, and
          especially on human livers, while the men and women in their own
          proper human form are sleeping quietly in their beds at home. Among
          them a man is either born a were-wolf or becomes one by infection;
          for mere contact with a were-wolf, or even with anything that has
          been touched by his spittle, is quite enough to turn the most
          innocent person into a were-wolf; nay even to lean your head
          against anything against which a were-wolf has leaned his head
          suffices to do it. The penalty for being a were-wolf is death; but
          the sentence is never passed until the accused has had a fair trial
          and his guilt has been clearly demonstrated by an ordeal, which
          consists in dipping the middle finger into boiling resin. If the
          finger is not burnt, the man is no were-wolf; but if it is burnt, a
          were-wolf he most assuredly is, so they take him away to a quiet
          spot and hack him to bits. In cutting him up the executioners are
          naturally very careful not to be bespattered with his blood, for if
          that were to happen they would of course be turned into were-wolves
          themselves. Further, they place his severed head beside his
          hinder-quarters to prevent his soul from coming to life again and
          pursuing his depredations. So great is the horror of were-wolves
          among the Toradjas, and so great is their fear of contracting the
          deadly taint by infection, that many persons have assured a
          missionary that they would not spare their own child if they knew
          him to be a were-wolf.<a id="noteref_763" name="noteref_763" href=

          these people, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page312">[pg
          312]</span><a name="Pg312" id="Pg312" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          whose faith in were-wolves is not a mere dying or dead superstition
          but a living, dreadful conviction, tell stories of were-wolves
          which conform to the type which we are examining. They say that
          once upon a time a were-wolf came in human shape under the house of
          a neighbour, while his real body lay asleep as usual at home, and
          calling out softly to the man's wife made an assignation with her
          to meet him in the tobacco-field next day. But the husband was
          lying awake and he heard it all, but he said nothing to anybody.
          Next day chanced to be a busy one in the village, for a roof had to
          be put on a new house and all the men were lending a hand with the
          work, and among them to be sure was the were-wolf himself, I mean
          to say his own human self; there he was up on the roof working away
          as hard as anybody. But the woman went out to the tobacco-field,
          and behind went unseen her husband, slinking through the underwood.
          When they were come to the field, he saw the were-wolf make up to
          his wife, so out he rushed and struck at him with a stick. Quick as
          thought, the were-wolf turned himself into a leaf, but the man was
          as nimble, for he caught up the leaf, thrust it into the joint of
          bamboo, in which he kept his tobacco, and bunged it up tight. Then
          he walked back with his wife to the village, carrying the bamboo
          with the were-wolf in it. When they came to the village, the human
          body of the were-wolf was still on the roof, working away with the
          rest. The man put the bamboo in a fire. At that the human were-wolf
          looked down from the roof and said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Don't
          do that.”</span> The man drew the bamboo from the fire, but a
          moment afterwards he put it in the fire again, and again the human
          were-wolf on the roof looked down and cried, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Don't do that.”</span> But this time the man kept the
          bamboo in the fire, and when it blazed up, down fell the human
          were-wolf from the roof as dead as a stone.<a id="noteref_764"

          Again, the following story went round among the Toradjas not so
          very many years ago. The thing happened at Soemara, on the Gulf of
          Tomori. It was evening and some men sat chatting with a certain
          Hadji Mohammad. When it had grown dark, one of the men went out of
          the house for something or other. A little while afterwards one of
          the company <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page313">[pg
          313]</span><a name="Pg313" id="Pg313" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          thought he saw a stag's antlers standing out sharp and clear
          against the bright evening sky. So Hadji Mohammad raised his gun
          and fired. A minute or two afterwards back comes the man who had
          gone out, and says he to Hadji Mohammad, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“You shot at me and hit me. You must pay me a
          fine.”</span> They searched him but found no wound on him anywhere.
          Then they knew that he was a were-wolf who had turned himself into
          a stag and had healed the bullet-wound by licking it. However, the
          bullet had found its billet, for two days afterwards he was a dead
          man.<a id="noteref_765" name="noteref_765" href=

          gorging themselves. But by day they are men again. It is very
          dangerous to shoot at such human hyaenas by night. On the Jebel
          Bela mountain a soldier once shot at a hyaena and hit it, but it
          dragged itself off, bleeding, in the darkness and escaped. Next
          morning he followed up the trail of blood and it led him straight

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the
          classical example of these stories is an old Roman tale told by
          Petronius. It is put in the mouth of one Niceros. Late at night he
          left the town to visit a friend of his, a widow, who lived at a
          farm five miles down the road. He <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page314">[pg 314]</span><a name="Pg314" id="Pg314" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> was accompanied by a soldier, who lodged in
          the same house, a man of Herculean build. When they set out it was
          near dawn, but the moon shone as bright as day. Passing through the
          outskirts of the town, they came amongst the tombs, which lined the
          highroad for some distance. There the soldier made an excuse for
          retiring behind a monument, and Niceros sat down to wait for him,
          humming a tune and counting the tombstones to pass the time. In a
          little he looked round for his companion, and saw a sight which
          froze him with horror. The soldier had stripped off his clothes to
          the last rag and laid them at the side of the highway. Then he
          performed a certain ceremony over them, and immediately was changed
          into a wolf, and ran howling into the forest. When Niceros had
          recovered himself a little, he went to pick up the clothes, but
          found that they were turned to stone. More dead than alive, he drew
          his sword, and, striking at every shadow cast by the tombstones on
          the moonlit road, he tottered to his friend's house. He entered it
          like a ghost, to the surprise of the widow, who wondered to see him
          abroad so late. <span class="tei tei-q">“If you had only been here
          a little ago,”</span> said she, <span class="tei tei-q">“you might
          have been of some use. For a wolf came tearing into the yard,
          scaring the cattle and bleeding them like a butcher. But he did not
          get off so easily, for the servant speared him in the neck.”</span>
          After hearing these words, Niceros felt that he could not close an
          eye, so he hurried away home again. It was now broad daylight, but
          when he came to the place where the clothes had been turned to
          stone, he found only a pool of blood. He reached home, and there
          lay the soldier in bed like an ox in the shambles, and the doctor
          was bandaging his neck. <span class="tei tei-q">“Then I
          knew,”</span> said Niceros, <span class="tei tei-q">“that the man
          was a were-wolf, and never again could I break bread with him, no,

          may help us to understand the custom of burning a bewitched animal,
          which has been observed in our own country down to recent times, if
          indeed it is even now extinct. For a close parallel may be traced
          in some respects between witches and were-wolves. Like were-wolves,
          witches are commonly supposed to be able to transform themselves
          temporarily into animals for the purpose of playing their
          mischievous pranks;<a id="noteref_768" name="noteref_768" href=

          like were-wolves they can in their animal disguise be compelled to
          unmask themselves to any one who succeeds in drawing their blood.
          In either case the animal-skin is conceived as a cloak thrown round
          the wicked enchanter; and if you can only pierce the skin, whether
          by the stab of a knife or the shot of a gun, you so rend the
          disguise that the man or woman inside of it stands revealed in his
          or her true colours. Strictly speaking, the stab should be given on
          the brow or between the eyes in the case both of a witch and of a
          were-wolf;<a id="noteref_769" name="noteref_769" href=

          it is vain to shoot at a were-wolf unless you have had the bullet
          blessed in a chapel <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page316">[pg

          of St. Hubert or happen to be carrying about you, without knowing
          it, a four-leaved clover; otherwise the bullet will merely rebound
          from the were-wolf like water from a duck's back.<a id=

          However, in Armenia they say that the were-wolf, who in that
          country is usually a woman, can be killed neither by shot nor by
          steel; the only way of delivering the unhappy woman from her
          bondage is to get hold of her wolf's skin and burn it; for that
          naturally prevents her from turning into a wolf again. But it is
          not easy to find the skin, for she is cunning enough to hide it by
          day.<a id="noteref_771" name="noteref_771" href=

          with witches, it is not only useless but even dangerous to shoot at
          one of them when she has turned herself into a hare; if you do, the
          gun may burst in your hand or the shot come back and kill you. The
          only way to make quite sure of hitting a witch-animal is to put a

          creature excited his suspicion, so he put a silver sixpence in his
          gun and fired at it. Instantly the black sheep became a woman with
          a drugget coat wrapt round her head. The man knew her quite well,
          for she was a witch who had often persecuted him before in the

          To take a few instances out of a multitude, a young man in the

          But such an old woman, a reputed witch, was found dead in her bed

          Yorkshire during the latter half of the nineteenth century a parish
          clergyman was told a circumstantial story of an old witch named
          Nanny, who was hunted in the form of a hare for several miles over
          the Westerdale moors and kept well away from the dogs, till a black
          one joined the pack and succeeded in taking a bit out of one of the
          hare's legs. That was the end of the chase, and immediately
          afterwards the sportsmen found old Nanny laid up in bed with a sore
          leg. On examining the wounded limb they discovered that the hurt
          was precisely in that part of it which in the hare had been bitten
          by the black dog and, what was still more significant, the wound
          had all the appearance of having been inflicted by a dog's teeth.
          So they put two and two together.<a id="noteref_777" name=

          day the witch had her face all tied up, and shortly afterwards
          died.”</span> Again, a Bardney bumpkin told how a witch in his
          neighbourhood could take all sorts of shapes. One night a man shot
          a hare, and when he went to the witch's house he found her
          plastering a wound just where he had shot the hare.<a id=

          County Leitrim, in Ireland, they say that a hare pursued by dogs
          fled to a house near at hand, but just as it was bolting in at the
          door one of the dogs came up with it and nipped a piece out of its
          leg. The hunters entered the house and found no hare there but only
          an old woman, and her side was bleeding; so they knew what to think

          take the air at the foot of the Mont des Fourches. All the

          month, but not one of them could hit it. At last one marksman, more
          knowing than the rest, loaded his gun with some pellets of a
          consecrated wafer in addition to the usual pellets of lead. That
          did the trick. If puss was not killed outright, she was badly hurt,
          and limped away uttering shrieks and curses in a human voice. Later
          it transpired that she was no other than the witch of a

          who was betrothed to a young woman and used to visit her every
          evening when he was off duty. But one evening the girl told him
          that he must not come to the house on Friday nights, because it was
          never convenient to her to see him then. This roused his suspicion,
          and the very next Friday night he set out to go to his sweetheart's
          house. On the way a white cat ran up to him in the street and
          dogged his steps, and when the animal would not make off he drew
          his sword and slashed off one of its paws. On that the cat bolted.
          The soldier walked on, but when he came to his sweetheart's house
          he found her in bed, and when he asked her what was the matter, she
          gave a very confused reply. Noticing stains of blood on the bed, he
          drew down the coverlet and saw that the girl was weltering in her

          Again, a farmer in the neighbourhood of Wiesensteig frequently

          the matter to the smith. The smith said quietly, <span class=

          just you send for me.”</span> Well, it was not long before the

          smith. He came bringing four horse-shoes with him, and said,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“I'm sure the nag has no shoes; I'll shoe

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Once more, in
          Silesia they tell of a miller's apprentice, a sturdy and
          industrious young fellow, who set out on his travels. One day he
          came to a mill, and the miller told <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page320">[pg 320]</span><a name="Pg320" id="Pg320" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> him that he wanted an apprentice but did not
          care to engage one, because hitherto all his apprentices had run
          away in the night, and when he came down in the morning the mill
          was at a stand. However, he liked the looks of the young chap and
          took him into his pay. But what the new apprentice heard about the
          mill and his predecessors was not encouraging; so the first night
          when it was his duty to watch in the mill he took care to provide
          himself with an axe and a prayer-book, and while he kept one eye on
          the whirring, humming wheels he kept the other on the good book,
          which he read by the flickering light of a candle set on a table.
          So the hours at first passed quietly with nothing to disturb him
          but the monotonous drone and click of the machinery. But on the
          stroke of twelve, as he was still reading with the axe lying on the
          table within reach, the door opened and in came two grey cats
          mewing, an old one and a young one. They sat down opposite him, but
          it was easy to see that they did not like his wakefulness and the
          prayer-book and the axe. Suddenly the old cat reached out a paw and
          made a grab at the axe, but the young chap was too quick for her
          and held it fast. Then the young cat tried to do the same for the
          prayer-book, but the apprentice gripped it tight. Thus balked, the
          two cats set up such a squalling that the young fellow could hardly
          say his prayers. Just before one o'clock the younger cat sprang on
          the table and fetched a blow with her right paw at the candle to
          put it out. But the apprentice struck at her with his axe and
          sliced the paw off, whereupon the two cats vanished with a
          frightful screech. The apprentice wrapped the paw up in paper to
          shew it to his master. Very glad the miller was next morning when
          he came down and found the mill going and the young chap at his
          post. The apprentice told him what had happened in the night and
          gave him the parcel containing the cat's paw. But when the miller
          opened it, what was the astonishment of the two to find in it no
          cat's paw but a woman's hand! At breakfast the miller's young wife
          did not as usual take her place at the table. She was ill in bed,
          and the doctor had to be called in to bind up her right arm,
          because in hewing wood, so they said, she had made a slip and cut
          off her own right hand. But <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It would no
          doubt be easy to multiply instances, all equally well attested and

          inflicted on the animals.<a id="noteref_785" name="noteref_785"

          the foregoing evidence may suffice to establish the complete
          parallelism between witches and were-wolves in these respects. The
          analogy appears to confirm the view that the reason for burning a
          bewitched animal alive is a belief that the witch herself is in the
          animal, and that by burning it you either destroy the witch
          completely or at least unmask her and compel her to reassume her
          proper human shape, in which she is naturally far less potent for
          mischief than when she is careering about the country in the
          likeness of a cat, a hare, a horse, or what not. This principle is
          still indeed clearly recognized by people in Oldenburg, though, as
          might be expected, they do not now carry out the principle to its
          logical conclusion by burning the bewitched animal or person alive;
          instead they resort to a feeble and, it must be added, perfectly
          futile subterfuge dictated by a mistaken humanity or a fear of the
          police. <span class="tei tei-q">“When anything living is bewitched
          in a house, for example, children or animals, they burn or boil the
          nobler inwards of animals, especially the hearts, but also the
          lungs or the liver. If animals have died, they take the inwards of
          one of them or of an animal of the same kind slaughtered for the
          purpose; but if that is not possible they take the inwards of a
          cock, by preference a black one. The <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page322">[pg 322]</span><a name="Pg322" id="Pg322" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> heart, lung, or liver is stuck all over with
          needles, or marked with a cross cut, or placed on the fire in a
          tightly closed vessel, strict silence being observed and doors and
          windows well shut. When the heart boils or is reduced to ashes, the
          witch must appear, for during the boiling she feels the burning
          pain. She either begs to be released or seeks to borrow something,
          for example, salt or a coal of fire, or she takes the lid off the
          pot, or tries to induce the person whose spell is on her to speak.
          They say, too, that a woman comes with a spinning-wheel. If it is a
          sheep that has died, you proceed in the same way with a tripe from
          its stomach and prick it with needles while it is on the boil.
          Instead of boiling it, some people nail the heart to the highest
          rafter of the house, or lay it on the edge of the hearth, in order
          that it may dry up, no doubt because the same thing happens to the
          witch. We may conjecture that other sympathetic means of
          destruction are employed against witchcraft. The following is
          expressly reported: the heart of a calf that has died is stuck all
          over with needles, enclosed in a bag, and thrown into flowing water
          before sunset.”</span><a id="noteref_786" name="noteref_786" href=

          another way of breaking the spell. It is often said that the
          burning should take place at a cross-road, and in several places
          cross-roads are shewn where the burning used to be performed.... As
          a rule, while the things are burning, the guilty witches appear,

          example, a young man in Oldenburg was wooing a girl, and she gave
          him two fine apples as a gift. Not feeling any appetite at the
          time, he put the apples in his pocket, and when he came home he
          laid them by in a chest. Two or three days afterwards he remembered
          the apples and went to the chest to fetch them. But when he would
          have put his hand on them, what was his horror to find in their
          stead two fat ugly toads in the chest! He hastened to a wise man
          and asked him what he should do with the toads. The man told him to
          boil the toads alive, but while he was doing so he must be sure on
          no account to lend anything out of the house. Well, just as he had
          the toads in a pot on the fire and the water began to grow nicely
          warm, who should come to the door but the girl who had given him
          the apples, and she wished to borrow something; but he refused to
          give her anything, rated her as a witch, and drove her out of the
          house. A little afterwards in came the girl's mother and begged
          with tears in her eyes for something or other; but he turned her
          out also. The last word she said to him was that he should at least
          spare her daughter's life; but he paid no heed to her and let the
          toads boil till they fell to bits. Next day word came that the girl
          was dead.<a id="noteref_789" name="noteref_789" href=

          it is well understood in Ireland and has been acted on within
          recent years. In March 1895 a peasant named Michael Cleary,
          residing at Ballyvadlea, a remote and lonely district in the county
          of Tipperary, burned his wife <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          "tei tei-anchor"></a> Bridget Cleary alive over a slow fire on the
          kitchen hearth in the presence of and with the active assistance of
          some neighbours, including the woman's own father and several of
          her cousins. They thought that she was not Bridget Cleary at all,
          but a witch, and that when they held her down on the fire she would
          vanish up the chimney; so they cried, while she was burning,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Away she goes! Away she goes!”</span> Even
          when she lay quite dead on the kitchen floor (for contrary to the
          general expectation she did not disappear up the chimney), her
          husband still believed that the woman lying there was a witch, and
          that his own dear wife had gone with the fairies to the old
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

          Kylenagranagh, where he would see her at night riding a grey horse
          and roped to the saddle, and that he would cut the ropes, and that
          she would stay with him ever afterwards. So he went with some
          friends to the fort night after night, taking a big table-knife
          with him to cut the ropes. But he never saw his wife again. He and
          the men who had held the woman on the fire were arrested and tried
          at Clonmel for wilful murder in July 1895; they were all found
          guilty of manslaughter and sentenced to various terms of penal
          servitude and imprisonment; the sentence passed on Michael Cleary
          was twenty years' penal servitude.<a id="noteref_790" name=

          the strict logical theory which seems to call for death by fire as

          Sometimes, perhaps in moments of weakness, they have merely buried
          the bewitched animals alive instead of burning them. For example,
          in the year 1643, <span class="tei tei-q">“many cattle having died,
          John Brughe and Neane Nikclerith, also one of the initiated,
          conjoined their mutual skill for the safety of the herd. The

          Again, during the prevalence of a murrain about the year 1629,
          certain persons proposed to stay the plague with the help of a
          celebrated <span class="tei tei-q">“cureing stane”</span> of which
          the laird of Lee was the fortunate owner. But from this they were
          dissuaded by one who <span class="tei tei-q">“had sene bestiall

          had herself endeavoured to check the progress of the distemper by
          taking <span class="tei tei-q">“ane quik ox with ane catt, and ane

          Writing towards the end of the eighteenth century, John Ramsay of
          Ochtertyre tells us that <span class="tei tei-q">“the violent death
          even of a brute is in some cases held to be of great avail. There
          is a disease called the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">black spauld</span></em>, which sometimes
          rages like a pestilence among black cattle, the symptoms of which
          are a mortification in the legs and a corruption of the mass of
          blood. Among the other engines of superstition that are directed
          against this fatal malady, the first cow seized with it is commonly
          buried alive, and the other cattle are forced to pass backwards and
          forwards over the pit. At other times the heart is taken out of the
          beast alive, and then the carcass is buried. It is remarkable that
          the leg affected is cut off, and hung up in some part of the house
          or byre, where it remains suspended, notwithstanding the seeming
          danger of infection. There is hardly a house in Mull where these
          may not be seen. This practice seems to have taken its rise
          antecedent to Christianity, as it reminds us of the pagan custom of
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page326">[pg 326]</span><a name=
          "Pg326" id="Pg326" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> hanging up offerings
          in their temples. In Breadalbane, when a cow is observed to have
          symptoms of madness, there is recourse had to a peculiar process.
          They tie the legs of the mad creature, and throw her into a pit dug
          at the door of the fold. After covering the hole with earth, a
          large fire is kindled upon it; and the rest of the cattle are
          driven out, and forced to pass through the fire one by
          one.”</span><a id="noteref_793" name="noteref_793" href=
          "#note_793"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">793</span></span></a> In
          this latter custom we may suspect that the fire kindled on the
          grave of the buried cow was originally made by the friction of
          wood, in other words, that it was a need-fire. Again, writing in
          the year 1862, Sir Arthur Mitchell tells us that <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“for the cure of the murrain in cattle, one of the herd
          is still sacrificed for the good of the whole. This is done by
          burying it alive. I am assured that within the last ten years such
          a barbarism occurred in the county of Moray.”</span><a id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Sometimes,
          however, the animal has not even been buried alive, it has been
          merely killed and then buried. In this emasculated form the
          sacrifice, we may say with confidence, is absolutely useless for
          the purpose of stopping a murrain. Nevertheless, it has been tried.
          Thus in Lincolnshire, <span class="tei tei-q">“when the cattle
          plague was so prevalent in 1866, there was, I believe, not a single
          cowshed in Marshland but had its wicken cross over the door; and
          other charms more powerful than this were in some cases resorted
          to. I never heard of the use of the needfire in the Marsh, though
          it was, I believe, used on the wolds not many miles off. But I knew
          of at least one case in which a calf was killed and solemnly buried
          feet pointing upwards at the threshold of the cowshed. When our
          garthman told me of this, I pointed out to him that the charm had
          failed, for the disease had not spared that shed. But he promptly
          replied, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Yis, but owd Edwards were a

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The foregoing
          survey of the popular fire-festivals of Europe suggests some
          general observations. In the first place we can hardly help being
          struck by the resemblance which the ceremonies bear to each other,
          at whatever time of the year and in whatever part of Europe they
          are celebrated. The custom of kindling great bonfires, leaping over
          them, and driving cattle through or round them would seem to have
          been practically universal throughout Europe, and the same may be
          said of the processions or races with blazing torches round fields,
          orchards, pastures, or cattle-stalls. Less widespread are the
          customs of hurling lighted discs into the air<a id="noteref_796"
          name="noteref_796" href="#note_796"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          trundling a burning wheel down hill;<a id="noteref_797" name=

          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">797</span></span></a> for
          to judge by the evidence which I have collected these modes of
          distributing the beneficial influence of the fire have been
          confined in the main to Central Europe. The ceremonial of the Yule
          log is distinguished from that of the other fire-festivals by the
          privacy and domesticity which characterize it; but, as we have
          already seen, this distinction may well be due simply to the rough
          weather of midwinter, which is apt not only to render a public
          assembly in the open air disagreeable, but also at any moment to
          defeat the object of the assembly by extinguishing the
          all-important fire under a downpour of rain or a fall of snow.
          Apart from these local or seasonal differences, the general
          resemblance between <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page329">[pg
          329]</span><a name="Pg329" id="Pg329" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          the fire-festivals at all times of the year and in all places is
          tolerably close. And as the ceremonies themselves resemble each
          other, so do the benefits which the people expect to reap from
          them. Whether applied in the form of bonfires blazing at fixed
          points, or of torches carried about from place to place, or of
          embers and ashes taken from the smouldering heap of fuel, the fire
          is believed to promote the growth of the crops and the welfare of
          man and beast, either positively by stimulating them, or negatively
          by averting the dangers and calamities which threaten them from
          such causes as thunder and lightning, conflagration, blight,
          mildew, vermin, sterility, disease, and not least of all
          witchcraft.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But we naturally
          ask, How did it come about that benefits so great and manifold were
          supposed to be attained by means so simple? In what way did people
          imagine that they could procure so many goods or avoid so many ills
          by the application of fire and smoke, of embers and ashes? In
          short, what theory underlay and prompted the practice of these
          customs? For that the institution of the festivals was the outcome
          of a definite train of reasoning may be taken for granted; the view
          that primitive man acted first and invented his reasons to suit his
          actions afterwards, is not borne out by what we know of his nearest
          living representatives, the savage and the peasant. Two different
          explanations of the fire-festivals have been given by modern
          enquirers. On the one hand it has been held that they are
          sun-charms or magical ceremonies intended, on the principle of
          imitative magic, to ensure a needful supply of sunshine for men,
          animals, and plants by kindling fires which mimic on earth the
          great source of light and heat in the sky. This was the view of
          Wilhelm Mannhardt.<a id="noteref_798" name="noteref_798" href=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">798</span></span></a> It
          may be called the solar theory. On the other hand it has been
          maintained that the ceremonial fires have no necessary reference to
          the sun but are simply purificatory in intention, being designed to
          burn up and destroy all harmful influences, whether these are
          conceived in a personal form as witches, demons, and monsters, or
          in an impersonal form as a sort of pervading taint or corruption of
          the air. This is the view of Dr. <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          may be called the purificatory theory. Obviously the two theories
          postulate two very different conceptions of the fire which plays
          the principal part in the rites. On the one view, the fire, like
          sunshine in our latitude, is a genial creative power which fosters
          the growth of plants and the development of all that makes for
          health and happiness; on the other view, the fire is a fierce
          destructive power which blasts and consumes all the noxious
          elements, whether spiritual or material, that menace the life of
          men, of animals, and of plants. According to the one theory the
          fire is a stimulant, according to the other it is a disinfectant;
          on the one view its virtue is positive, on the other it is
          negative.</p>

          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Yet the two
          explanations, different as they are in the character which they
          attribute to the fire, are perhaps not wholly irreconcilable. If we
          assume that the fires kindled at these festivals were primarily
          intended to imitate the sun's light and heat, may we not regard the
          purificatory and disinfecting qualities, which popular opinion
          certainly appears to have ascribed to them, as attributes derived
          directly from the purificatory and disinfecting qualities of
          sunshine? In this way we might conclude that, while the imitation
          of sunshine in these ceremonies was primary and original, the
          purification attributed to them was secondary and derivative. Such
          a conclusion, occupying an intermediate position between the two
          opposing theories and recognizing an element of truth in both of
          them, was adopted by me in earlier editions of this work;<a id=

          in the meantime Dr. Westermarck <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          purificatory theory alone, and I am bound to say that his arguments
          carry great weight, and that on a fuller review of the facts the
          balance of evidence seems to me to incline decidedly in his favour.
          However, the case is not so clear as to justify us in dismissing
          the solar theory without discussion, and accordingly I propose to
          adduce the considerations which tell for it before proceeding to
          notice those which tell against it. A theory which had the support
          of so learned and sagacious an investigator as W. Mannhardt is

          it would be no wonder if primitive man in Europe did the same.
          Indeed, when we consider the cold and cloudy climate of Europe
          during a great part of the year, we shall find it natural that
          sun-charms should have played a much more prominent part among the
          superstitious practices of European peoples than among those of
          savages who live nearer the equator and who consequently are apt to
          get in the course of nature more sunshine than they want. This view
          of the festivals may be supported by various arguments drawn partly
          from their dates, partly from the nature of the rites, and partly
          from the influence which they are believed to exert upon the

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">First, in regard
          to the dates of the festivals it can be no mere accident that two
          of the most important and widely spread of the festivals are timed
          to coincide more or less exactly with the summer and winter
          solstices, that is, with the two turning-points in the sun's
          apparent course in the sky when he reaches respectively his highest
          and his lowest elevation at noon. Indeed with respect to the
          midwinter celebration of Christmas we are not left to conjecture;
          we <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page332">[pg 332]</span><a name=
          "Pg332" id="Pg332" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> know from the
          express testimony of the ancients that it was instituted by the
          church to supersede an old heathen festival of the birth of the
          sun,<a id="noteref_803" name="noteref_803" href=
          "#note_803"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          was apparently conceived to be born again on the shortest day of
          the year, after which his light and heat were seen to grow till
          they attained their full maturity at midsummer. Therefore it is no
          very far-fetched conjecture to suppose that the Yule log, which
          figures so prominently in the popular celebration of Christmas, was
          originally designed to help the labouring sun of midwinter to
          rekindle his seemingly expiring light.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The idea that by
          lighting a log on earth you can rekindle a fire in heaven or fan it
          into a brighter blaze, naturally seems to us absurd; but to the
          savage mind it wears a different aspect, and the institution of the
          great fire-festivals which we are considering probably dates from a
          time when Europe was still sunk in savagery or at most in
          barbarism. Now it can be shewn that in order to increase the
          celestial source of heat at midwinter savages resort to a practice
          analogous to that of our Yule log, if the kindling of the Yule log
          was originally a magical rite intended to rekindle the sun. In the
          southern hemisphere, where the order of the seasons is the reverse
          of ours, the rising of Sirius or the Dog Star in July marks the
          season of the greatest cold instead of, as with us, the greatest
          heat; and just as the civilized ancients ascribed the torrid heat
          of midsummer to that brilliant star,<a id="noteref_804" name=

          the modern savage of South Africa attributes to it the piercing

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Not only the
          date of some of the festivals but the manner of their celebration
          suggests a conscious imitation of the sun. The custom of rolling a
          burning wheel down a hill, which is often observed at these
          ceremonies, might well pass for an imitation of the sun's course in
          the sky, and the imitation would be especially appropriate on
          Midsummer Day when the sun's annual declension begins. Indeed the
          custom has been thus interpreted by some of those who have recorded
          it.<a id="noteref_809" name="noteref_809" href=

          Again, the common practice of throwing fiery discs, sometimes
          expressly said to be shaped like suns, into the air at the
          festivals may well be a piece of imitative magic. In these, as in
          so many cases, the magic force may be supposed to take effect
          through mimicry or sympathy: by imitating the desired result you
          actually produce it: by counterfeiting the sun's progress through
          the heavens you really help the luminary to pursue his celestial
          journey with punctuality and despatch. The name <span class=

          sometimes popularly known,<a id="noteref_811" name="noteref_811"

          clearly implies a consciousness of a connexion between the earthly
          and the heavenly flame.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again, the
          manner in which the fire appears to have been originally kindled on
          these occasions has been alleged in support of the view that it was
          intended to be a mock-sun. As some scholars have perceived, it is
          highly probable <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page335">[pg
          335]</span><a name="Pg335" id="Pg335" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          that at the periodic festivals in former times fire was universally
          obtained by the friction of two pieces of wood.<a id="noteref_812"

          have seen that it is still so procured in some places both at the
          Easter and the midsummer festivals, and that it is expressly said
          to have been formerly so procured at the Beltane celebration both
          in Scotland and Wales.<a id="noteref_813" name="noteref_813" href=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">813</span></span></a> But
          what makes it nearly certain that this was once the invariable mode
          of kindling the fire at these periodic festivals is the analogy of
          the need-fire, which has almost always been produced by the
          friction of wood, and sometimes by the revolution of a wheel. It is
          a plausible conjecture that the wheel employed for this purpose
          represents the sun,<a id="noteref_814" name="noteref_814" href=
          "#note_814"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          if the fires at the regularly recurring celebrations were formerly
          produced in the same way, it might be regarded as a confirmation of
          the view that they were originally sun-charms. In point of fact
          there is, as Kuhn has indicated,<a id="noteref_815" name=
          "noteref_815" href="#note_815"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">815</span></span></a> some
          evidence to shew that the midsummer fire was originally thus
          produced. We have seen that many Hungarian swine-herds make fire on
          Midsummer Eve by rotating a wheel round a wooden axle wrapt in
          hemp, and that they drive their pigs through the fire thus
          made.<a id="noteref_816" name="noteref_816" href=

          Obermedlingen, in Swabia, the <span class="tei tei-q">“fire of

          fifteenth of June) by igniting a cart-wheel, which, smeared with
          pitch and plaited with straw, was fastened on a pole twelve feet
          high, the top of the pole being inserted in the nave of the wheel.
          This fire was <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page336">[pg

          the fixing of a wheel on a pole and igniting it suggests that
          originally the fire was produced, as in the case of the need-fire,
          by the revolution of a wheel. The day on which the ceremony takes
          place (the fifteenth of June) is near midsummer; and we have seen
          that in Masuren fire is, or used to be, actually made on Midsummer
          Day by turning a wheel rapidly about an oaken pole,<a id=

          though it is not said that the new fire so obtained is used to
          light a bonfire. However, we must bear in mind that in all such
          cases the use of a wheel may be merely a mechanical device to
          facilitate the operation of fire-making by increasing the friction;
          it need not have any symbolical significance.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Further, the

          supposed to exert on the weather and vegetation may be cited in
          support of the view that they are sun-charms, since the effects
          ascribed to them resemble those of sunshine. Thus, the French
          belief that in a rainy June the lighting of the midsummer bonfires
          will cause the rain to cease<a id="noteref_819" name="noteref_819"

          appears to assume that they can disperse the dark clouds and make
          the sun to break out in radiant glory, drying the wet earth and
          dripping trees. Similarly the use of the need-fire by Swiss
          children on foggy days for the purpose of clearing away the
          mist<a id="noteref_820" name="noteref_820" href=

          very naturally be interpreted as a sun-charm. Again, we have seen
          that in the Vosges Mountains the people believe that the midsummer
          fires help to preserve the fruits of the earth and ensure good
          crops.<a id="noteref_821" name="noteref_821" href=

          Sweden the warmth or cold of the coming season is inferred from the
          direction in which the flames of the May Day bonfire are blown; if
          they blow to the south, it will be warm, if to the north,
          cold.<a id="noteref_822" name="noteref_822" href=

          doubt at present the direction of the flames is regarded merely as
          an augury of the weather, not as a mode of influencing it. But we
          may be pretty sure that this is one of the cases in which magic has
          dwindled into divination. So in the Eifel <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page337">[pg 337]</span><a name="Pg337" id="Pg337" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> Mountains, when the smoke blows towards the
          corn-fields, this is an omen that the harvest will be
          abundant.<a id="noteref_823" name="noteref_823" href=

          the older view may have been not merely that the smoke and flames
          prognosticated, but that they actually produced an abundant
          harvest, the heat of the flames acting like sunshine on the corn.
          Perhaps it was with this view that people in the Isle of Man lit
          fires to windward of their fields in order that the smoke might
          blow over them.<a id="noteref_824" name="noteref_824" href=

          be interpreted as a remnant of the belief in the quickening and
          fertilizing power of the bonfires. The same belief, it may be
          argued, reappears in the notion that embers taken from the bonfires
          and inserted in the fields will promote the growth of the
          crops,<a id="noteref_828" name="noteref_828" href=

          it may be thought to underlie the customs of sowing flax-seed in

          href="#note_833"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">833</span></span></a>
          belongs clearly to the same class of ideas. Again, at Konz, on the
          banks of the Moselle, if the blazing wheel which was trundled down
          the hillside reached the river without being extinguished, this was
          hailed as a proof that the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page338">[pg 338]</span><a name="Pg338" id="Pg338" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> vintage would be abundant. So firmly was this
          belief held that the successful performance of the ceremony
          entitled the villagers to levy a tax upon the owners of the
          neighbouring vineyards.<a id="noteref_834" name="noteref_834" href=
          "#note_834"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">834</span></span></a> Here
          the unextinguished wheel might be taken to represent an unclouded
          sun, which in turn would portend an abundant vintage. So the
          waggon-load of white wine which the villagers received from the
          vineyards round about might pass for a payment for the sunshine
          which they had procured for the grapes. Similarly we saw that in
          the Vale of Glamorgan a blazing wheel used to be trundled down hill
          on Midsummer Day, and that if the fire were extinguished before the
          wheel reached the foot of the hill, the people expected a bad
          harvest; whereas if the wheel kept alight all the way down and
          continued to blaze for a long time, the farmers looked forward to
          heavy crops that summer.<a id="noteref_835" name="noteref_835"
          href="#note_835"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">835</span></span></a> Here,
          again, it is natural to suppose that the rustic mind traced a
          direct connexion between the fire of the wheel and the fire of the
          sun, on which the crops are dependent.</p>

          person is supposed to receive from, or to impart to, the fire a
          generative and fertilizing influence. The common practice of lovers
          leaping over the fires hand in hand may very well have originated
          in a notion that thereby their marriage would be blessed with
          offspring; and the like motive would explain the custom which
          obliges couples married within the year to dance to the light of

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At the festivals
          which we are considering the custom of kindling bonfires is
          commonly associated with a custom of carrying lighted torches about
          the fields, the orchards, the pastures, the flocks and the herds;
          and we can hardly doubt that the two customs are only two different
          ways of attaining the same object, namely, the benefits which are
          believed to flow from the fire, whether it be stationary or

          Accordingly if we accept the solar theory of the bonfires, we seem
          bound to apply it also to the torches; we must suppose that the
          practice of marching or running with blazing torches about the
          country is simply a means of diffusing far and wide the genial
          influence of the sunshine, of which these flickering flames are a
          feeble imitation. In favour of this view it may be said that
          sometimes the torches are carried about the fields for the express
          purpose of fertilizing them,<a id="noteref_850" name="noteref_850"

          wildly through the fields and orchards with lighted torches, which
          they wave about the branches and dash against the trunks of the

          torches, chanting invocations the while, and this is supposed to
          ensure bountiful crops for the next season.<a id="noteref_854"

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus far we have
          considered what may be said for the theory that at the European
          fire-festivals the fire is kindled as a charm to ensure an abundant
          supply of sunshine for man and beast, for corn and fruits. It
          remains to consider what may be said against this theory and in
          favour of the view that in these rites fire is employed not as a
          creative but as a cleansing agent, which purifies men, animals, and
          plants by burning up and consuming the noxious elements, whether
          material or spiritual, which menace all living things with disease
          and death.</p>

              <span style="font-size: 80%">The purificatory or destructive
              effect of the fires is often alleged by the people who light
              them. The great evil against which the fire at the festivals is
              directed appears to be witchcraft.</span>
            </div>
          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">First, then, it
          is to be observed that the people who practise the fire-customs
          appear never to allege the solar theory in explanation of them,
          while on the contrary they do frequently and emphatically put
          forward the purificatory theory. This is a strong argument in
          favour of the purificatory and against the solar theory; for the
          popular explanation of a popular custom is never to be rejected
          except for grave cause. And in the present case there seems to be
          no adequate reason for rejecting it. The conception of fire as a
          destructive agent, which can be turned to account for the
          consumption of evil things, is so simple and obvious that it could
          hardly escape the minds even of the rude peasantry with whom these
          festivals originated. On the other hand the conception of fire as
          an emanation of the sun, or at all events as linked to it by a bond
          of physical sympathy, is far less simple and obvious; and though
          the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page342">[pg 342]</span><a name=
          "Pg342" id="Pg342" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> use of fire as a
          charm to produce sunshine appears to be undeniable,<a id=

          nevertheless in attempting to explain popular customs we should
          never have recourse to a more recondite idea when a simpler one
          lies to hand and is supported by the explicit testimony of the
          people themselves. Now in the case of the fire-festivals the
          destructive aspect of fire is one upon which the people dwell again
          and again; and it is highly significant that the great evil against
          which the fire is directed appears to be witchcraft. Again and
          again we are told that the fires are intended to burn or repel the
          witches;<a id="noteref_858" name="noteref_858" href=
          "#note_858"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">858</span></span></a> and
          the intention is sometimes graphically expressed by burning an
          effigy of a witch in the fire.<a id="noteref_859" name=

          Hence, when we remember the great hold which the dread of
          witchcraft has had on the popular European mind in all ages, we may
          suspect that the primary intention of all these fire-festivals was
          simply to destroy or at all events get rid of the witches, who were
          regarded as the causes of nearly all the misfortunes and calamities
          that befall men, their cattle, and their crops.<a id="noteref_860"

              effect of witchcraft.</span>
            </div>
          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This suspicion
          is confirmed when we examine the evils for which the bonfires and
          torches were supposed to provide a remedy. Foremost, perhaps, among
          these evils we may reckon the diseases of cattle; and of all the
          ills that witches are believed to work there is probably none which
          is so constantly insisted on as the harm they do to the herds,
          particularly by stealing the milk from the cows.<a id="noteref_861"

          it is significant that the need-fire, which may perhaps be regarded
          as the parent of the periodic fire-festivals, is kindled above all
          as a remedy for a murrain or other disease of cattle; and the
          circumstance suggests, what on general grounds seems probable, that
          the custom of kindling the need-fire goes back to a time when the
          ancestors of the European peoples subsisted chiefly on the products
          of their herds, and when agriculture as yet played a subordinate
          part in their lives. Witches and wolves are the two great foes
          still dreaded by the herdsman in many parts of Europe;<a id=

          we need not wonder that he should resort to fire as a powerful
          means of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page344">[pg
          344]</span><a name="Pg344" id="Pg344" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          banning them both. Among Slavonic peoples it appears that the foes
          whom the need-fire is designed to combat are not so much living
          witches as vampyres and other evil spirits,<a id="noteref_863"

          the ceremony, as we saw, aims rather at repelling these baleful
          beings than at actually consuming them in the flames. But for our
          present purpose these distinctions are immaterial. The important
          thing to observe is that among the Slavs the need-fire, which is
          probably the original of all the ceremonial fires now under
          consideration, is not a sun-charm, but clearly and unmistakably
          nothing but a means of protecting man and beast against the attacks
          of maleficent creatures, whom the peasant thinks to burn or scare
          by the heat of the fire, just as he might burn or scare wild
          animals.</p>

          the fire which bans the witches necessarily serves at the same time

          flaming discs which are hurled into the air, but also to the
          burning wheels which are rolled down hill on these occasions; discs
          and wheels, we may suppose, are alike intended to burn the witches
          who hover invisible in the air or haunt unseen the fields, the

          Certainly witches are constantly thought to ride through the air on
          broomsticks or other equally convenient vehicles; and if they do
          so, how can you get at them so effectually as by hurling lighted
          missiles, whether discs, torches, or besoms, after them as they
          flit past overhead in the gloom? The South Slavonian peasant
          believes that witches ride in the dark hail-clouds; so he shoots at
          the clouds to bring down the hags, while he curses them, saying,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Curse, curse Herodias, thy mother is a
          heathen, damned of God and fettered through the Redeemer's
          blood.”</span> Also he brings out a pot of glowing charcoal on
          which he has thrown holy oil, laurel leaves, and wormwood to make a
          smoke. The fumes are supposed to ascend to the clouds and stupefy
          the witches, so that they tumble down to earth. And in order that
          they may not fall soft, but may hurt themselves very much, the
          yokel hastily brings out a chair and tilts it bottom up so that the
          witch in falling may break her legs on the legs of the chair. Worse
          than that, he cruelly lays scythes, bill-hooks and other formidable
          weapons edge upwards so as to cut and mangle <span class=

          which the fire has magically generated; it is merely an indirect
          result obtained by freeing the reproductive powers of plants and
          animals from the fatal obstruction of witchcraft. And what is true
          of the reproduction of plants and animals may hold good also of the
          fertility of the human sexes. We have seen that the bonfires are
          supposed to promote marriage and to procure offspring for childless
          couples. This happy effect need not flow directly from any
          quickening or fertilizing energy in the fire; it may follow

          not the only part of the world where ceremonies of this sort have
          been performed; elsewhere the passage through the flames or smoke
          or over the glowing embers of a bonfire, which is the central
          feature of most of the rites, has been employed as a cure or a
          preventive of various ills. We have seen that the midsummer ritual
          of fire in Morocco is practically identical with that of our

          (Brisbane and London, 1897), p. 156, § 265. The custom of killing a
          man by pointing a bone or stick at him, while the sorcerer utters
          appropriate curses, is common among the tribes of Central
          Australia; but amongst them there seems to be no objection to place

          is usual for snakes to meet in companies; and that, by joining
          heads together, and hissing, a kind of bubble is formed, which the
          rest, by continual hissing, blow on till it passes quite through
          the body, and then it immediately hardens, and resembles a

          Campana. From Mr. Dennett's account (<span class=

          cit.</span></span> pp. 53, 67-71) we gather that drought and famine
          are thought to result from the intercourse of a man with a girl who
          has not yet passed through the <span class=

          young women live in seclusion. According to O. Dapper, the women of
          Loango paint themselves red on every recurrence of their monthly
          sickness; also they tie a cord tightly round their heads and take
          care neither to touch their husband's food nor to appear before him

          Wilfred Powell's description of the New Ireland custom is similar
          (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Wanderings in a Wild Country</span></span>,
          London, 1883, p. 249). According to him, the girls wear wreaths of
          scented herbs round the waist and neck; an old woman or a little
          child occupies the lower floor of the cage; and the confinement
          lasts only a month. Probably the long period mentioned by Dr. Brown
          is that prescribed for chiefs' daughters. Poor people could not
          afford to keep their children so long idle. This distinction is
          sometimes expressly stated. See above, p. <a href="#Pg030" class=
          "tei tei-ref">30</a>. Among the Goajiras of Colombia rich people
          keep their daughters shut up in separate huts at puberty for
          periods varying from one to four years, but poor people cannot
          afford to do so for more than a fortnight or a month. See F. A.
          Simons, <span class="tei tei-q">“An Exploration of the Goajira
          Peninsula,”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          who were being tattooed were kept from the sun (Thomas Williams,

          the Fijians</span></span>, Second Edition, London, 1860, i. 170).
          This was perhaps a modification of the Melanesian custom of
          secluding girls at puberty. The reason mentioned by Mr. Williams,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“to improve her complexion,”</span> can
          hardly have been the original one.</dd>

          also by some Indian tribes of California, but apparently rather for
          the purpose of producing a sweat than for the sake of concealment.
          The treatment lasted only twenty-four hours, during which the
          patient was removed from the ground and washed three or four times,
          to be afterwards reimbedded. Dancing was kept up the whole time by

          two accounts appear to be identical; but the former attributes the
          custom to the Chiriguanos, the latter to the Lenguas. As the latter
          account is based on the reports of the Rev. W. B. Grubb, a
          missionary who has been settled among the Indians of the Chaco for
          many years and is our principal authority on them, I assume that
          the ascription of the custom to the Lenguas is correct. However, in
          the volume on the Lengua Indians, which has been edited from Mr.
          Grubb's papers (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          <dd class="tei tei-notetext">As a confirmation of this view it may
          be pointed out that beating or scourging is inflicted on inanimate
          objects expressly for the purpose indicated in the text. Thus the
          Indians of Costa Rica hold that there are two kinds of ceremonial
          uncleanness, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">nya</span></span> and <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=

          connected with a death is <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">nya</span></span>.
          But <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">bu-ku-rú</span></span> is much more virulent.
          It can not only make one sick but kill. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Bu-ku-rú</span></span> emanates in a variety
          of ways; arms, utensils, even houses become affected by it after
          long disuse, and before they can be used again must be purified. In
          the case of portable objects left undisturbed for a long time, the
          custom is to beat them with a stick before touching them. I have
          seen a woman take a long walking-stick and beat a basket hanging
          from the roof of a house by a cord. On asking what that was for, I
          was told that the basket contained her treasures, that she would
          probably want to take something out the next day, and that she was
          driving off the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">bu-ku-rú</span></span>. A house long unused
          must be swept, and then the person who is purifying it must take a
          stick and beat not only the movable objects, but the beds, posts,
          and in short every accessible part of the interior. The next day it
          is fit for occupation. A place not visited for a long time or
          reached for the first time is <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">bu-ku-rú</span></span>. On our return from the
          ascent of Pico Blanco, nearly all the party suffered from little
          calenturas, the result of extraordinary exposure to wet and cold
          and of want of food. The Indians said that the peak was especially
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">bu-ku-rú</span></span>, since nobody had ever
          been on it before.”</span> One day Mr. Gabb took down some dusty
          blow-guns amid cries of <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">bu-ku-rú</span></span> from the Indians. Some
          weeks afterwards a boy died, and the Indians firmly believed that
          the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">bu-ku-rú</span></span> of the blow-guns had
          killed him. <span class="tei tei-q">“From all the foregoing, it
          would seem that <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">bu-ku-rú</span></span> is a sort of evil
          spirit that takes possession of the object, and resents being
          disturbed; but I have never been able to learn from the Indians
          that they consider it so. They seem to think of it as a property
          the object acquires. But the worst <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">bu-ku-rú</span></span> of all, is that of a
          young woman in her first pregnancy. She infects the whole
          neighbourhood. Persons going from the house where she lives, carry
          the infection with them to a distance, and all the deaths or other
          serious misfortunes in the vicinity are laid to her charge. In the
          old times, when the savage laws and customs were in full force, it
          was not an uncommon thing for the husband of such a woman to pay
          damages for casualties thus caused by his unfortunate wife.”</span>

          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          occurs in other folk-tales. A prince or princess is shut up for
          safety in a tower and makes his or her escape by scraping a hole in
          the wall with a bone which has been accidentally conveyed into the
          tower; sometimes it is expressly said that care was taken to let
          the princess have no bones with her meat (J. G. von Hahn,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">op.
          cit.</span></span> No. 15; L. Gonzenbach, <span class=

          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">sqq.</span></span>).
          From this we should infer that it is a rule with savages not to let
          women handle the bones of animals during their monthly seclusions.
          We have already seen the great respect with which the savage treats
          the bones of game (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Spirits of the Corn and of the
          Wild</span></span>, ii. 238 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">sqq.</span></span>);
          and women in their courses are specially forbidden to meddle with
          the hunter or fisher, as their contact or neighbourhood would spoil
          his sport (see below, pp. <a href="#Pg077" class=
          "tei tei-ref">77</a>, <a href="#Pg078" class="tei tei-ref">78</a>
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">sqq.</span></span>). In folk-tales the hero
          who uses the bone is sometimes a boy; but the incident might easily
          be transferred from a girl to a boy after its real meaning had been
          forgotten. Amongst the Tinneh Indians a girl at puberty is
          forbidden to break the bones of hares (above, p. <a href="#Pg048"
          class="tei tei-ref">48</a>). On the other hand, she drinks out of a
          tube made of a swan's bone (above, pp. <a href="#Pg048" class=
          "tei tei-ref">48</a>, <a href="#Pg049" class="tei tei-ref">49</a>),
          and the same instrument is used for the same purpose by girls of
          the Carrier tribe of Indians (see below, p. <a href="#Pg092" class=
          "tei tei-ref">92</a>). We have seen that a Tlingit (Thlinkeet) girl
          in the same circumstances used to drink out of the wing-bone of a
          white-headed eagle (above, p. <a href="#Pg045" class=
          "tei tei-ref">45</a>), and that among the Nootka and Shuswap tribes
          girls at puberty are provided with bones or combs with which to
          scratch themselves, because they may not use their fingers for this
          purpose (above, pp. <a href="#Pg044" class="tei tei-ref">44</a>,

          pork. Another correspondent writes to me: <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“The prohibition that a menstruating woman must not
          touch meat that is intended for keeping appears to be common all
          over the country; at least I have met with it as a confirmed and
          active custom in widely separated parts of England.... It is in
          regard to the salting of meat for bacon that the prohibition is
          most usual, because that is the commonest process; but it exists in
          regard to any meat food that is required to be kept.”</span></dd>

          their custom to sprinkle the same potent liquid on the doorposts
          and houses all round to guard them from harm. The fluid was applied
          by means of a wisp of straw, and the person who discharged this

          the torches which are carried about the streets and the fields; the

          observed on the same Sunday in Franche-Comté, requires that couples
          married within the year should distribute boiled peas to all the
          young folks of both sexes who demand them at the door. The lads and
          lasses go about from house to house, making the customary request;
          in some places they wear masks or are otherwise disguised. See Ch.

          These candles were sometimes of prodigious size; in the cathedrals

          name of the Judas Light or the Judas Candle; and sometimes small
          waxen figures of Judas were hung on them. See H. J. Feasey,

          The distribution of the new fire in the Church of the Holy

          printed notes on the picture, with which Mrs. Holman Hunt was so
          kind as to furnish me, it appears that the new fire is carried by
          horsemen to Bethlehem and Jaffa, and that a Russian ship conveys it
          from Jaffa to Odessa, whence it is distributed all over the
          country.</dd>

          sacred fire as well as to preserve it when it was once made, is
          perhaps explained by a superstition current among French peasants
          that if a girl can blow up a smouldering candle into a flame she is
          a virgin, but that if she fails to do so, she is not. See Jules

          but upon many other occasions. When a Highlander goes to bathe, or
          to drink waters out of a consecrated fountain, he must always
          approach by going round the place, <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">from east to west
          on the south side</span></em>, in imitation of the apparent diurnal
          motion of the sun. When the dead are laid in the earth, the grave
          is approached by going round in the same manner. The bride is
          conducted to her future spouse, in the presence of the minister,
          and the glass goes round a company, in the course of the sun. This
          is called, in Gaelic, going round the right, or the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">lucky
          way</span></em>. The opposite course is the wrong, or the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">unlucky</span></em> way. And if a person's
          meat or drink were to affect the wind-pipe, or come against his
          breath, they instantly cry out <span lang="gd" class=
          "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="gd"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">deisheal!</span></span> which is an
          ejaculation praying that it may go by the right way”</span> (Rev.
          J. Robertson, in Sir John Sinclair's <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Statistical Account

          everything,’</span> and consists in doing all things with a motion
          corresponding to the course of the sun, or from left to right. This
          is the manner in which screw-nails are driven, and is common with
          many for no reason but its convenience. Old men in the Highlands
          were very particular about it. The coffin was taken <span lang="gd"
          class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="gd"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">deiseal</span></span> about the grave, when
          about to be lowered; boats were turned to sea according to it, and
          drams are given to the present day to a company. When putting a
          straw rope on a house or corn-stack, if the assistant went
          <span lang="gd" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="gd"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">tuaitheal</span></span> (<span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>
          against the course of the sun), the old man was ready to come down
          and thrash him. On coming to a house the visitor should go round it
          <span lang="gd" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="gd"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">deiseal</span></span> to secure luck in the
          object of his visit. After milking a cow the dairy-maid should
          strike it <span lang="gd" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
          "gd"><span style="font-style: italic">deiseal</span></span> with

          (<span lang="gd" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="gd"><span style=

          its safe return. The word is from <span lang="gd" class=

          contains no allusion to the sun.”</span> Compare M. Martin,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Description of the Western Islands of
          Scotland,”</span> in J. Pinkerton's <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Voyages and
          Travels</span></span>, iii. 612 <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">sq.</span></span>:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“There was an ancient custom in the island
          of Lewis, to make a fiery circle about the houses, corn, cattle,
          etc., belonging to each particular family: a man carried fire in
          his right hand, and went round, and it was called <span lang="gd"
          class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="gd"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">dessil</span></span>, from the right hand,
          which in the ancient language is called <span lang="gd" class=
          "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="gd"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">dess</span></span>.... There is another way of
          the <span lang="gd" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
          "gd"><span style="font-style: italic">dessil</span></span>, or
          carrying fire round about women before they are churched, after
          child-bearing; and it is used likewise about children until they
          are christened; both which are performed in the morning and at
          night. This is only practised now by some of the ancient midwives:
          I enquired their reason for this custom, which I told them was
          altogether unlawful; this disobliged them mightily, insomuch that
          they would give me no satisfaction. But others, that were of a more
          agreeable temper, told me that fire-round was an effectual means to
          preserve both the mother and the infant from the power of evil
          spirits, who are ready at such times to do mischief, and sometimes
          carry away the infant; and when they get them once in their
          possession, return them poor meagre skeletons; and these infants
          are said to have voracious appetites, constantly craving for meat.
          In this case it was usual with those who believed that their
          children were thus taken away, to dig a grave in the fields upon
          quarter-day, and there to lay the fairy skeleton till next morning;
          at which time the parents went to the place, where they doubted not
          to find their own child instead of this skeleton. Some of the
          poorer sort of people in these islands retain the custom of
          performing these rounds sun-ways about the persons of their
          benefactors three times, when they bless them, and wish good
          success to all their enterprizes. Some are very careful when they
          set out to sea that the boat be first rowed about sun-ways; and if
          this be neglected, they are afraid their voyage may prove
          unfortunate.”</span> Probably the superstition was based entirely
          on the supposed luckiness of the right hand, which accordingly, in
          making a circuit round an object, is kept towards the centre. As to
          a supposed worship of the sun among the Scottish Highlanders,
          compare J. G. Campbell, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Witchcraft and Second Sight in the Highlands
          and Islands of Scotland</span></span>, p. 304: <span class=

          relating to witches at this season are legion. For instance, in
          Saxony and Thuringia any one who labours under a physical blemish
          can easily rid himself of it by transferring it to the witches on
          Walpurgis Night. He has only to go out to a cross-road, make three
          crosses on the blemish, and say, <span class="tei tei-q">“In the
          name of God the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.”</span> Thus
          the blemish, whatever it may be, is left behind him at the
          cross-road, and when the witches sweep by on their way to the
          Brocken, they must take it with them, and it sticks to them
          henceforth. Moreover, three crosses chalked up on the doors of
          houses and cattle-stalls on Walpurgis Night will effectually
          prevent any of the infernal crew from entering and doing harm to
          man or beast. See E. Sommer, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            Officiorum</span></span>, lib. vii. cap. 14 (p. 442 <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">verso</span></span>, ed. Lyons, 1584).
            Compare J. Grimm, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Deutsche
            Mythologie</span></span>,<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With the
            notion that the air is poisoned at midsummer we may compare the
            popular belief that it is similarly infected at an eclipse. Thus
            among the Esquimaux on the Lower Yukon river in Alaska
            <span class="tei tei-q">“it is believed that a subtle essence or
            unclean influence descends to the earth during an eclipse, and if
            any of it is caught in utensils of any kind it will produce
            sickness. As a result, immediately on the commencement of an
            eclipse, every woman turns bottom side up all her pots, wooden
            buckets, and dishes”</span> (E. W. Nelson, <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“The Eskimo about Bering Strait,”</span> <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Eighteenth Annual
            Report of the Bureau of American Ethnology</span></span>, Part i.
            (Washington, 1899) p. 431). Similar notions and practices prevail
            among the peasantry of southern Germany. Thus the Swabian
            peasants think that during an eclipse of the sun poison falls on
            the earth; hence at such a time they will not sow, mow, gather
            fruit or eat it, they bring the cattle into the stalls, and
            refrain from business of every kind. If the eclipse lasts long,
            the people get very anxious, set a burning candle on the
            mantel-shelf of the stove, and pray to be delivered from the
            danger. See Anton Birlinger, <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Volksthümliches aus
            Schwaben</span></span> (Freiburg im Breisgau, 1861-1862), i. 189.
            Similarly Bavarian peasants imagine that water is poisoned during
            a solar eclipse (F. Panzer, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Beitrag zur deutschen
            Mythologie</span></span>, ii. 297); and Thuringian bumpkins cover
            up the wells and bring the cattle home from pasture during an
            eclipse either of the sun or of the moon; an eclipse is
            particularly poisonous when it happens to fall on a Wednesday.
            See August Witzschel, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Sagen, Sitten und Gebräuche aus
            Thüringen</span></span> (Vienna, 1878), p. 287. As eclipses are
            commonly supposed by the ignorant to be caused by a monster
            attacking the sun or moon (E. B. Tylor, <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Primitive
            Culture</span></span>,<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">sqq.</span></span>), we may surmise, on the
            analogy of the explanation given of the Midsummer fires, that the
            unclean influence which is thought to descend on the earth at
            such times is popularly attributed to seed discharged by the
            monster or possibly by the sun or moon then in conjunction with
            each other.</p>

          pointed out, the Catholic Church succeeded in altering the date of
          the festival by one day, but not in changing the character of the
          festival. All Souls' Day is now the second instead of the first of
          November. But we can hardly doubt that the Saints, who have taken
          possession of the first of November, wrested it from the Souls of
          the Dead, the original proprietors. After all, the Saints are only
          one particular class of the Souls of the Dead; so that the change
          which the Church effected, no doubt for the purpose of disguising
          the heathen character of the festival, is less great than appears
          at first sight.</dd>

          with the fork.</dd>

          ages, and even so late as towards the middle of the nineteenth
          century, the Servian village organisation and the Servian
          agriculture had yet another distinguishing feature. The dangers
          from wild beasts in old time, the want of security for life and
          property during the Turkish rule, or rather misrule, the natural
          difficulties of the agriculture, more especially the lack in
          agricultural labourers, induced the Servian peasants not to leave
          the parental house but to remain together on the family's property.
          In the same yard, within the same fence, one could see around the
          ancestral house a number of wooden huts which contained one or two
          rooms, and were used as sleeping places for the sons, nephews and
          grandsons and their wives. Men and women of three generations could
          be often seen living in that way together, and working together the
          land which was considered as common property of the whole family.
          This expanded family, remaining with all its branches together,
          and, so to say, under the same roof, working together, dividing the
          fruits of their joint labours together, this family and an
          agricultural association in one, was called <span lang="sr" class=

          combination of family and agricultural association has morally,
          economically, socially, and politically rendered very important
          services to the Servians. The headman or chief (called <span lang=

          "font-style: italic">Stareshina</span></span>) of such family
          association is generally the oldest male member of the family. He
          is the administrator of the common property and director of work.
          He is the executive chairman of the association. Generally he does
          not give any order without having consulted all the grown-up male
          members of the <span lang="sr" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=

          up within the chimney, in order to preserve the rest of the cattle
          from being infected. It is believed that as long as it hangs there,
          it will prevent the disease from approaching the place. It is

          that they had experienced great difficulty that year in rearing
          their calves; the poor little creatures all died off, so they had

          we may conjecture that the intention of cutting off the legs or
          cutting out the heart, liver, and lungs of the animals and hanging
          them up or boiling them, is by means of homoeopathic magic to
          inflict corresponding injuries on the witch who cast the fatal

          Sometimes the motive seems to be a fear of burning or at least
          singeing a ghost, who is hovering invisible in the air; sometimes
          it is apparently an idea that a fire is old and tired with burning

          62-80. In North Germany it is believed that a man can turn himself
          into a wolf by girding himself with a strap made out of a wolf's
          hide. Some say that the strap must have nine, others say twelve,
          holes and a buckle; and that according to the number of the hole
          through which the man inserts the tongue of the buckle will be the
          length of time of his transformation. For example, if he puts the
          tongue of the buckle through the first hole, he will be a wolf for
          one hour; if he puts it through the second, he will be a wolf for
          two days; and so on, up to the last hole, which entails a
          transformation for a full year. But by putting off the girdle the
          man can resume his human form. The time when were-wolves are most
          about is the period of the Twelve Nights between Christmas and
          Epiphany; hence cautious German farmers will not remove the dung
          from the cattle-stalls at that season for fear of attracting the
          were-wolves to the cattle. See Adalbert Kuhn, <span class=

          Märchen</span></span> (Berlin, 1843), p. 375; Ulrich Jahn,

          (London, 1900), iii. 312: <span class="tei tei-q">“The custom of
          leaping over the fire and driving cattle through it may be
          intended, on the one hand, to secure for man and beast a share of
          the vital energy of the sun, and, on the other hand, to purge them
          of all evil influences; for to the primitive mind fire is the most
          powerful of all purificatory agents”</span>; and again,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">id.</span></span> iii. 314: <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“It is quite possible that in these customs the idea of
          the quickening power of fire may be combined with the conception of
          it as a purgative agent for the expulsion or destruction of evil
          beings, such as witches and the vermin that destroy the fruits of
          the earth. Certainly the fires are often interpreted in the latter
          way by the persons who light them; and this purgative use of the
          element comes out very prominently, as we have seen, in the general
          expulsion of demons from towns and villages. But in the present
          class of cases this aspect of fire may be secondary, if indeed it
          is more than a later misinterpretation of the custom.”</span></dd>

          explained by this custom. See <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          torches in the modern European customs are imitations of lightning.
          At some of their ceremonies the Indians of North-West America
          imitate lightning by means of pitch-wood torches which are flashed
          through the roof of the house. See J. G. Swan, quoted by Franz

              freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project

              generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Project
              Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread
              public support and donations to carry out its mission of
              increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that
              can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible
              by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment.
              Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important
              to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
              Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
              charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the
              United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it
              takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to
              meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit
              donations in locations where we have not received written
              confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the
              status of compliance for any particular state visit <a href=

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While we
              cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
              have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no
              prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors
              in such states who approach us with offers to donate.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
              International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot
              make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations
              received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp
              our small staff.</p>
